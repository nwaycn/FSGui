PostgreSQL pl/pgsql Debugger API
================================

This module is a set of shared libraries which implement an API for debugging
pl/pgsql functions on PostgreSQL 8.4 and above. The pgAdmin project
(http://www.pgadmin.org/) provides a client user interface as part of pgAdmin 
III v1.10.0 and above.

If you wish to debug functions on PostgreSQL 8.2 or 8.3, please use v0.93 of
the debugger plugin, or checkout the PRE_8_4_SERVER branch from CVS.


Installation
------------

- Copy this directory to contrib/ in your PostgreSQL source tree.

- Run 'make; make install'

- Edit your postgresql.conf file, and modify the shared_preload_libraries config
  option to look like:

  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/plugin_debugger'

- Restart PostgreSQL for the new setting to take effect.

- Run the following command in the database or databases that you wish to
  debug functions in:

  CREATE EXTENSION pldbgapi;

  (on server versions older than 9.1, you must instead run the pldbgapi--1.0.sql
  script directly using psql).


Usage
-----

Connect pgAdmin to the database containing the functions you wish to debug.
Right-click the function to debug, and select Debugging->Debug to execute and
debug the function immediately, or select Debugging->Set Global Breakpoint to
set a breakpoint on the function. This will cause the debugger to wait for
another session (such as a backend servicing a web app) to execute the function
and allow you to debug in-context.

For further information, please see the pgAdmin documentation.


Troubleshooting
---------------

The majority of problems we've encountered with the plugin are caused by
failing to add (or incorrectly adding) the debugger plugin library to the
shared_preload_libraries configuration directive in postgresql.conf (following
which, the server *must* be restarted). This will prevent global breakpoints
working on all platforms, and on some (notably Windows) may prevent the 
pldbgapi.sql script from executing correctly.


Architecture
------------

The debugger consists of three parts:

1. The client. This is typically a GUI displays the source code, current
   stack frame, variables etc, and allows the user to set breakpoints and
   step throught the code. The client can reside on a different host than
   the database server.

2. The target backend. This is the backend that runs the code being debugged.
   The plugin_debugger.so library must be loaded into the target backend.

3. Debugging proxy. This is another backend process that the client is
   connected to. The API functions, pldbg_* in pldbgapi.so library, are
   run in this backend.

The client is to connected to the debugging proxy using a regular libpq
connection. When a debugging session is active, the proxy is connected
to the target via a socket. The protocol between the proxy and the target
backend is not visible to others, and is subject to change. The pldbg_*
API functions form the public interface to the debugging facility.
