><P
>   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"

> is true in a row representing a lock
   held by the indicated transaction.  False indicates that this transaction is
   currently waiting to acquire this lock, which implies that some other
   transaction is holding a conflicting lock mode on the same lockable object.
   The waiting transaction will sleep until the other lock is released (or a
   deadlock situation is detected). A single transaction can be waiting to
   acquire at most one lock at a time.
  </P
><P
>   Every transaction holds an exclusive lock on its virtual transaction ID for
   its entire duration.  If a permanent ID is assigned to the transaction
   (which normally happens only if the transaction changes the state of the
   database), it also holds an exclusive lock on its permanent transaction ID
   until it ends.  When one transaction finds it necessary to wait specifically
   for another transaction, it does so by attempting to acquire share lock on
   the other transaction ID (either virtual or permanent ID depending on the
   situation). That will succeed only when the other transaction
   terminates and releases its locks.
  </P
><P
>   Although tuples are a lockable type of object,
   information about row-level locks is stored on disk, not in memory,
   and therefore row-level locks normally do not appear in this view.
   If a transaction is waiting for a
   row-level lock, it will usually appear in the view as waiting for the
   permanent transaction ID of the current holder of that row lock.
  </P
><P
>   Advisory locks can be acquired on keys consisting of either a single
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bigint</TT
> value or two integer values.
   A <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bigint</TT
> key is displayed with its
   high-order half in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>classid</TT
> column, its low-order half
   in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>objid</TT
> column, and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>objsubid</TT
> equal
   to 1. The original <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bigint</TT
> value can be reassembled with the
   expression <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>(classid::bigint &lt;&lt; 32) |
   objid::bigint</TT
>. Integer keys are displayed with the
   first key in the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>classid</TT
> column, the second key in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>objid</TT
>
   column, and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>objsubid</TT
> equal to 2.  The actual meaning of
   the keys is up to the user.  Advisory locks are local to each database,
   so the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>database</TT
> column is meaningful for an advisory lock.
  </P
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_locks</TT
> provides a global view of all locks
   in the database cluster, not only those relevant to the current database.
   Although its <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>relation</TT
> column can be joined
   against <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_class</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>oid</TT
> to identify locked
   relations, this will only work correctly for relations in the current
   database (those for which the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>database</TT
> column
   is either the current database's OID or zero).
  </P
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>pid</TT
> column can be joined to the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>pid</TT
> column of the <A
HREF="monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW"
><TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_stat_activity</TT

>
   view to get more
   information on the session holding or waiting to hold each lock,
   for example
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_stat_activity psa
    ON pl.pid = psa.pid;</PRE
><P>
   Also, if you are using prepared transactions, the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>virtualtransaction</TT
> column can be joined to the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>transaction</TT
> column of the <A
HREF="view-pg-prepared-xacts.html"
><TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_prepared_xacts</TT
></A
>
   view to get more information on prepared transactions that hold locks.
   (A prepared transaction can never be waiting for a lock,
   but it continues to hold the locks it acquired while running.)
   For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_prepared_xacts ppx
    ON pl.virtualtransaction = '-1/' || ppx.transaction;</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_locks</TT
> view displays data from both the
   regular lock manager and the predicate lock manager, which are
   separate systems; in addition, the regular lock manager subdivides its
   locks into regular and <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>fast-path</I
> locks.
   This data is not guaranteed to be entirely consistent.
   When the view is queried,
   data on fast-path locks (with <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fastpath</TT
> = <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>true</TT
>)
   is gathered from each backend one at a time, without freezing the state of
   the entire lock manager, so it is possible for locks to be taken or
   released while information is gathered.  Note, however, that these locks are
   known not to conflict with any other lock currently in place.  After
   all backends have been queried for fast-path locks, the remainder of the
   regular lock manager is locked as a unit, and a consistent snapshot of all
   remaining locks is collected as an atomic action.  After unlocking the
   regular lock manager, the predicate lock manager is similarly locked and all
   predicate locks are collected as an atomic action.  Thus, with the exception
   of fast-path locks, each lock manager will deliver a consistent set of
   results, but as we do not lock both lock managers simultaneously, it is
   possible for locks to be taken or released after we interrogate the regular
   lock manager and before we interrogate the predicate lock manager.
  </P
><P
>   Locking the regular and/or predicate lock manager could have some
   impact on database performance if this view is very frequently accessed.
   The locks are held only for the minimum amount of time necessary to
   obtain data from the lock managers, but this does not completely eliminate
   the possibility of a performance impact.
