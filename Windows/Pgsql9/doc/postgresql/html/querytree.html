>    To understand how the rule system works it is necessary to know
    when it is invoked and what its input and results are.</P
><P
>    The rule system is located between the parser and the planner.
    It takes the output of the parser, one query tree, and the user-defined
    rewrite rules, which are also
    query trees with some extra information, and creates zero or more
    query trees as result. So its input and output are always things
    the parser itself could have produced and thus, anything it sees
    is basically representable as an <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> statement.</P
><P
>    Now what is a query tree? It is an internal representation of an
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> statement where the single parts that it is
    built from are stored separately. These query trees can be shown
    in the server log if you set the configuration parameters
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>debug_print_parse</TT
>,
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>debug_print_rewritten</TT
>, or
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>debug_print_plan</TT
>.  The rule actions are also
    stored as query trees, in the system catalog
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_rewrite</TT
>.  They are not formatted like
    the log output, but they contain exactly the same information.</P
><P
>    Reading a raw query tree requires some experience.  But since
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> representations of query trees are
    sufficient to understand the rule system, this chapter will not
    teach how to read them.</P
><P
>    When reading the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM

    query trees in this chapter it is necessary to be able to identify
    the parts the statement is broken into when it is in the query tree
    structure. The parts of a query tree are

        In the query tree, the range table entries are referenced by
        number rather than by name, so here it doesn't matter if there
        are duplicate names as it would in an <ACRONYM

        (<ACRONYM

        <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT

        target list entries for any columns that were not assigned to by
        the original command but have defaults.  Any remaining columns (with
        neither a given value nor a default) will be filled in by the
        planner with a constant null expression.
    </P
><P
>        For <TT

        handle missing columns by inserting expressions that copy the values
        from the old row into the new one.  Just as for <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT

        the rule system adds a <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

        the executor can identify the old row to be updated.

        tree made of function calls, constants, variables, operators, etc.

><P

>the join tree</DT
><DD
><P
>        The query's join tree shows the structure of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
> clause.
        For a simple query like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT ... FROM a, b, c</TT
>, the join tree is just
        a list of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
> items, because we are allowed to join them in
        any order.  But when <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JOIN</TT
> expressions, particularly outer joins,
        are used, we have to join in the order shown by the joins.
        In that case, the join tree shows the structure of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JOIN</TT
> expressions.  The
        restrictions associated with particular <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JOIN</TT
> clauses (from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON</TT
> or
        <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USING</TT
> expressions) are stored as qualification expressions attached
        to those join-tree nodes.  It turns out to be convenient to store
        the top-level <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> expression as a qualification attached to the
        top-level join-tree item, too.  So really the join tree represents
        both the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clauses of a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
>.

><DD
><P
>        The other parts of the query tree like the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT

        clause aren't of interest here. The rule system
        substitutes some entries there while applying rules, but that
        doesn't have much to do with the fundamentals of the rule
        system.
