>   Individual leaf tuples and inner tuples must fit on a single index page
   (8KB by default).  Therefore, when indexing values of variable-length
   data types, long values can only be supported by methods such as radix
   trees, in which each level of the tree includes a prefix that is short
   enough to fit on a page, and the final leaf level includes a suffix also
   short enough to fit on a page.  The operator class should set
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>longValuesOK</TT
> to TRUE only if it is prepared to arrange for
   this to happen.  Otherwise, the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SP-GiST</ACRONYM
> core will
   reject any request to index a value that is too large to fit
   on an index page.
  </P
><P
>   Likewise, it is the operator class's responsibility that inner tuples
   do not grow too large to fit on an index page; this limits the number
   of child nodes that can be used in one inner tuple, as well as the
   maximum size of a prefix value.
  </P
><P
>   Another limitation is that when an inner tuple's node points to a set
   of leaf tuples, those tuples must all be in the same index page.
   (This is a design decision to reduce seeking and save space in the
   links that chain such tuples together.)  If the set of leaf tuples
   grows too large for a page, a split is performed and an intermediate
   inner tuple is inserted.  For this to fix the problem, the new inner
   tuple <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>must</I
></SPAN
> divide the set of leaf values into more than one
   node group.  If the operator class's <CODE

   fails to do that, the <ACRONYM

>   Some tree algorithms use a fixed set of nodes for each inner tuple;
   for example, in a quad-tree there are always exactly four nodes
   corresponding to the four quadrants around the inner tuple's centroid
   point.  In such a case the code typically works with the nodes by
   number, and there is no need for explicit node labels.  To suppress
   node labels (and thereby save some space), the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>picksplit</CODE
>
   function can return NULL for the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>nodeLabels</TT
> array.
   This will in turn result in <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>nodeLabels</TT
> being NULL during
   subsequent calls to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>choose</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>inner_consistent</CODE
>.
   In principle, node labels could be used for some inner tuples and omitted
   for others in the same index.

   for <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

   of nodes is supposed to be fixed in such cases.  Also, there is no
   provision for generating an unlabeled node in <TT
