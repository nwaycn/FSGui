>      Fix WAL replay of locking an already-updated tuple (Andres Freund,
      &Aacute;lvaro Herrera)
     </P
><P
>      This error caused updated rows to not be found by index scans, resulting
      in inconsistent query results depending on whether an index scan was
      used.  Subsequent processing could result in constraint violations,
      since the previously updated row would not be found by later index
      searches, thus possibly allowing conflicting rows to be inserted.
      Since this error is in WAL replay, it would only manifest during crash
      recovery or on standby servers.  The improperly-replayed case most
      commonly arises when a table row that is referenced by a foreign-key
      constraint is updated concurrently with creation of a referencing row.

>      Restore GIN metapages unconditionally to avoid torn-page risk
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </P
><P
>      Although this oversight could theoretically result in a corrupted
      index, it is unlikely to have caused any problems in practice, since
      the active part of a GIN metapage is smaller than a standard 512-byte
      disk sector.
