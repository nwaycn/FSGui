      check for errors reported by the underlying system library calls;
      the main case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations.
      In the worst case this might lead to information exposure, due to our
      code assuming that a buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been.
      Also, there were a few places in which security-relevant calls of other
      system library functions did not check for failure.
     </P

      to not be large, but will continue analysis in this area.

>      Protect against wraparound of multixact member IDs
      (&Aacute;lvaro Herrera, Robert Haas, Thomas Munro)

      be insufficient, allowing <TT

      removed too early, resulting in data loss.
      The fix for this includes modifying the server to fail transactions
      that would result in overwriting old multixact member ID data, and
      improving autovacuum to ensure it will act proactively to prevent
      multixact member ID wraparound, as it does for transaction ID
      wraparound.

      if there was no match you got a scalar null result, whereas what you
      should get is an empty set (zero rows).  Second, the <TT

      was effectively ignored, since you would get only one result array even
      if there were multiple matches.
     </P
><P

      depending on the former behavior; therefore the function declarations
      will not be changed by default until <SPAN

      In pre-9.5 branches, the old behavior exists in version 1.0 of

      declarations in version 1.1 (which is <SPAN

      is HOT-updated (that is, no indexed columns change and the row can be
      stored back onto the same table page) later in the same transaction,
      the exclusion constraint would be reported as violated when the check
      finally occurred, even if the row(s) the new row originally conflicted

><P
>      This hack was added in 2003 in response to a report that some Linux
      kernels of the time would report IPv4 connections as having
      IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses.  However, the logic was accidentally broken in
      9.0.  The lack of any field complaints since then shows that it's not
      needed anymore.  Now we have reports that the broken code causes
      crashes on some systems, so let's just remove it rather than fix it.
      (Had we chosen to fix it, that would make for a subtle and potentially
      security-sensitive change in the effective meaning of
      IPv4 <TT

      to opportunistically drain input when it can, but a full defense
