    longer of interest to any transaction. The space it occupies must then be
    reclaimed for reuse by new rows, to avoid unbounded growth of disk

    It also requires extra disk space for the new copy of the table, until

    often enough to avoid needing <TT

    autovacuum daemon attempts to work this way, and in fact will
    never issue <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT

    is not to keep tables at their minimum size, but to maintain steady-state
    usage of disk space: each table occupies space equivalent to its
    minimum size plus however much space gets used up between vacuumings.
    Although <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> can be used to shrink a table back
    to its minimum size and return the disk space to the operating system,
    there is not much point in this if the table will just grow again in the
    future.  Thus, moderately-frequent standard <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    better approach than infrequent <TT

    maintaining heavily-updated tables.
   </P
><P
>    Some administrators prefer to schedule vacuuming themselves, for example
    doing all the work at night when load is low.
    The difficulty with doing vacuuming according to a fixed schedule
    is that if a table has an unexpected spike in update activity, it may
    get bloated to the point that <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> is really necessary
    to reclaim space.  Using the autovacuum daemon alleviates this problem,
    since the daemon schedules vacuuming dynamically in response to update
    activity.  It is unwise to disable the daemon completely unless you
    have an extremely predictable workload.  One possible compromise is
    to set the daemon's parameters so that it will only react to unusually
    heavy update activity, thus keeping things from getting out of hand,
    while scheduled <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>s are expected to do the bulk of the
    work when the load is typical.
   </P
><P
>    For those not using autovacuum, a typical approach is to schedule a
    database-wide <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> once a day during a low-usage period,
    supplemented by more frequent vacuuming of heavily-updated tables as
    necessary. (Some installations with extremely high update rates vacuum
    their busiest tables as often as once every few minutes.) If you have
    multiple databases in a cluster, don't forget to
    <TT

>Tip: </B

    a table contains large numbers of dead row versions as a result of
    massive update or delete activity.  If you have such a table and
    you need to reclaim the excess disk space it occupies, you will need
    to use <TT

    These commands rewrite an entire new copy of the table and build
    new indexes for it.  All these options require exclusive lock.  Note that
    they also temporarily use extra disk space approximately equal to the size
    of the table, since the old copies of the table and indexes can't be
    released until the new ones are complete.

    are more useful for heavily-updated tables than for seldom-updated

    statistics updates if the statistical distribution of the data is
    not changing much. A simple rule of thumb is to think about how much
    the minimum and maximum values of the columns in the table change.
    For example, a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT

    of row update will have a constantly-increasing maximum value as
    rows are added and updated; such a column will probably need more
    frequent statistics updates than, say, a column containing URLs for
    pages accessed on a website. The URL column might receive changes just
    as often, but the statistical distribution of its values probably
    changes relatively slowly.

    In practice, however, it is usually best to just analyze the entire

    If these warnings are
