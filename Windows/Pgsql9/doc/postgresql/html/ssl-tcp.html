   In principle it need

   that CA would also be trusted for client certificates.

    password can be left blank. The program will generate a key that is
    passphrase protected; it will not accept a passphrase that is less
    than four characters long. To remove the passphrase (as you must if
    you want automatic start-up of the server), run the commands:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out server.key
rm privkey.pem</PRE
><P>
    Enter the old passphrase to unlock the existing key. Now do:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>openssl req -x509 -in server.req -text -key server.key -out server.crt</PRE
><P>
    to turn the certificate into a self-signed certificate and to copy
    the key and certificate to where the server will look for them.
    Finally do:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>chmod og-rwx server.key</PRE
><P>
    because the server will reject the file if its permissions are more
    liberal than this.
    For more details on how to create your server private key and
    certificate, refer to the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>OpenSSL</SPAN
> documentation.
   </P

    signed by a certificate authority (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CA</ACRONYM
>) (either one of the
    global <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CAs</ACRONYM
> or a local one) should be used in production
    so that clients can verify the server's identity. If all the clients
    are local to the organization, using a local <ACRONYM
