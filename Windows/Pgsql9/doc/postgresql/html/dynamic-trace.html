>    SystemTap uses a different notation for trace scripts than DTrace does,
    even though the underlying trace points are compatible.  One point worth
    noting is that at this writing, SystemTap scripts must reference probe
    names using double underscores in place of hyphens.  This is expected to
    be fixed in future SystemTap releases.

>   You should remember that DTrace scripts need to be carefully written and
   debugged, otherwise the trace information collected might
   be meaningless. In most cases where problems are found it is the
   instrumentation that is at fault, not the underlying system. When
   discussing information found using dynamic tracing, be sure to enclose
   the script used to allow that too to be checked and discussed.

     Note the use of the double underline in the probe name. In a DTrace
     script using the probe, the double underline needs to be replaced with a
     hyphen, so <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>transaction-start</TT

     users.

      usually not worth worrying about if you are just reporting the

      function calls into the arguments.  If you need to do that,
      consider protecting the macro with a check to see if the trace
      is actually enabled:
