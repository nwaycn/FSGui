      cause nothing worse than an unexpected verification failure, but there
      are some rather-implausible scenarios in which it might allow one
      certificate holder to impersonate another.  The victim would have to
      have a common name exactly 32 bytes long, and the attacker would have
      to persuade a trusted CA to issue a certificate in which the common
      name has that string as a prefix.  Impersonating a server would also
      require some additional exploit to redirect client connections.

      after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table locations.
      This bug has been present since release 8.2, but occurs so infrequently
      that it was not diagnosed until now.  If you have reason to suspect
      that it has happened in your database, reindexing the affected index
      will fix things.

>      Avoid crashing when we have problems deleting table files post-commit
      (Tom Lane)
     </P
><P
>      Dropping a table should lead to deleting the underlying disk files only
      after the transaction commits.  In event of failure then (for instance,
      because of wrong file permissions) the code is supposed to just emit a
      warning message and go on, since it's too late to abort the
      transaction.  This logic got broken as of release 8.4, causing such
      situations to result in a PANIC and an unrestartable database.

><P
>      Replay will attempt to remove the tablespace's directories, but there
      are various reasons why this might fail (for example, incorrect
      ownership or permissions on those directories).  Formerly the replay
      code would panic, rendering the database unrestartable without manual
      intervention.  It seems better to log the problem and continue, since
      the only consequence of failure to remove the directories is some
      wasted disk space.

>      Track the OID counter correctly during WAL replay, even when it wraps
      around (Tom Lane)
     </P
><P
>      Previously the OID counter would remain stuck at a high value until the
      system exited replay mode.  The practical consequences of that are
      usually nil, but there are scenarios wherein a standby server that's
      been promoted to master might take a long time to advance the OID
      counter to a reasonable value once values are needed.
