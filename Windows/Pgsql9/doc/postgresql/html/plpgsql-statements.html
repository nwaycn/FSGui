CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>variable</I
></TT
> { := | = } <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>expression</I
></TT
>;</PRE
><P>
     As explained previously, the expression in such a statement is evaluated
     by means of an SQL <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> command sent to the main
     database engine.  The expression must yield a single value (possibly
     a row value, if the variable is a row or record variable).  The target
     variable can be a simple variable (optionally qualified with a block
     name), a field of a row or record variable, or an element of an array
     that is a simple variable or field.  Equal (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
>) can be
     used instead of PL/SQL-compliant <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>:=</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>     If the expression's result data type doesn't match the variable's
     data type, the value will be coerced as though by an assignment cast
     (see <A
HREF="typeconv-query.html"
>Section 10.4</A
>).  If no assignment cast is known
     for the pair of data types involved, the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
>
     interpreter will attempt to convert the result value textually, that is
     by applying the result type's output function followed by the variable
     type's input function.  Note that this could result in run-time errors
     generated by the input function, if the string form of the result value
     is not acceptable to the input function.

     <SPAN

     These symbols refer to values supplied in the <TT

     into the command string as text: it avoids run-time overhead of
     converting the values to text and back, and it is much less prone
     to SQL-injection attacks since there is no need for quoting or escaping.
     An example is:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE 'SELECT count(*) FROM mytable WHERE inserted_by = $1 AND inserted &lt;= $2'
   INTO c
   USING checked_user, checked_date;</PRE
><P>
    </P
><P
>     Note that parameter symbols can only be used for data values
     &mdash; if you want to use dynamically determined table or column
     names, you must insert them into the command string textually.
     For example, if the preceding query needed to be done against a
     dynamically selected table, you could do this:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE 'SELECT count(*) FROM '
    || quote_ident(tabname)
    || ' WHERE inserted_by = $1 AND inserted &lt;= $2'
   INTO c
   USING checked_user, checked_date;</PRE
><P>
     A cleaner approach is to use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>format()</CODE
>'s <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%I</TT
>
     specification for table or column names (strings separated by a
     newline are concatenated):
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE format('SELECT count(*) FROM %I '
   'WHERE inserted_by = $1 AND inserted &lt;= $2', tabname)
   INTO c
   USING checked_user, checked_date;</PRE
><P>
     Another restriction on parameter symbols is that they only work in
     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>, and
     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> commands.  In other statement
     types (generically called utility statements), you must insert
     values textually even if they are just data values.
    </P
><P
>     An <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXECUTE</TT
> with a simple constant command string and some
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USING</TT

     functionally equivalent to just writing the command directly in
     <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> and allowing replacement of

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN

     The important difference is that <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXECUTE</TT
> will re-plan

>Example 40-1. Quoting Values In Dynamic Queries</B
></P
><P
>     When working with dynamic commands you will often have to handle escaping
     of single quotes.  The recommended method for quoting fixed text in your
     function body is dollar quoting.  (If you have legacy code that does
     not use dollar quoting, please refer to the
     overview in <A
HREF="plpgsql-development-tips.html#PLPGSQL-QUOTE-TIPS"
>Section 40.11.1</A
>, which can save you
     some effort when translating said code to a more reasonable scheme.)
    </P
><P
>     Dynamic values require careful handling since they might contain
     quote characters.
     An example using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>format()</CODE
> (this assumes that you are
     dollar quoting the function body so quote marks need not be doubled):
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE format('UPDATE tbl SET %I = $1 '
   'WHERE key = $2', colname) USING newvalue, keyvalue;</PRE
><P>
     It is also possible to call the quoting functions directly:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = '
        || quote_literal(newvalue)
        || ' WHERE key = '
        || quote_literal(keyvalue);</PRE
><P>
    </P
><P
>     This example demonstrates the use of the
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_ident</CODE
> and
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_literal</CODE
> functions (see <A
HREF="functions-string.html"
>Section 9.4</A
>).  For safety, expressions containing column
     or table identifiers should be passed through
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_ident</CODE
> before insertion in a dynamic query.
     Expressions containing values that should be literal strings in the
     constructed command should be passed through <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_literal</CODE
>.
     These functions take the appropriate steps to return the input text
     enclosed in double or single quotes respectively, with any embedded
     special characters properly escaped.
    </P
><P
>     Because <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_literal</CODE
> is labeled
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STRICT</TT
>, it will always return null when called with a
     null argument.  In the above example, if <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newvalue</TT
> or
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>keyvalue</TT
> were null, the entire dynamic query string would
     become null, leading to an error from <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXECUTE</TT
>.
     You can avoid this problem by using the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_nullable</CODE
>
     function, which works the same as <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_literal</CODE
> except that
     when called with a null argument it returns the string <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
>.
     For example,
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = '
        || quote_nullable(newvalue)
        || ' WHERE key = '
        || quote_nullable(keyvalue);</PRE
><P>
     If you are dealing with values that might be null, you should usually
     use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_nullable</CODE
> in place of <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_literal</CODE
>.
    </P
><P
>     As always, care must be taken to ensure that null values in a query do
     not deliver unintended results.  For example the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>'WHERE key = ' || quote_nullable(keyvalue)</PRE
><P>
     will never succeed if <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>keyvalue</TT
> is null, because the
     result of using the equality operator <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
> with a null operand
     is always null.  If you wish null to work like an ordinary key value,
     you would need to rewrite the above as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>'WHERE key IS NOT DISTINCT FROM ' || quote_nullable(keyvalue)</PRE
><P>
     (At present, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IS NOT DISTINCT FROM</TT
> is handled much less
     efficiently than <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
>, so don't do this unless you must.
     See <A
HREF="functions-comparison.html"
>Section 9.2</A
> for
     more information on nulls and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IS DISTINCT</TT
>.)
    </P
><P
>     Note that dollar quoting is only useful for quoting fixed text.
     It would be a very bad idea to try to write this example as:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = $$'
        || newvalue
        || '$$ WHERE key = '
        || quote_literal(keyvalue);</PRE
><P>
     because it would break if the contents of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newvalue</TT
>
     happened to contain <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$$</TT
>.  The same objection would
     apply to any other dollar-quoting delimiter you might pick.
     So, to safely quote text that is not known in advance, you
     <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>must</I
></SPAN
> use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_literal</CODE
>,
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_nullable</CODE
>, or <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_ident</CODE
>, as appropriate.
    </P
><P
>     Dynamic SQL statements can also be safely constructed using the
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>format</CODE
> function (see <A
HREF="functions-string.html"
>Section 9.4</A
>). For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE format('UPDATE tbl SET %I = %L '
   'WHERE key = %L', colname, newvalue, keyvalue);</PRE
><P>
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%I</TT
> is equivalent to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_ident</CODE
>, and
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%L</TT
> is equivalent to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_nullable</CODE
>.
     The <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>format</CODE
> function can be used in conjunction with
     the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USING</TT
> clause:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE format('UPDATE tbl SET %I = $1 WHERE key = $2', colname)
   USING newvalue, keyvalue;</PRE
><P>
     This form is better because the variables are handled in their native
     data type format, rather than unconditionally converting them to
     text and quoting them via <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%L</TT
>.  It is also more efficient.
