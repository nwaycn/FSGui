> (Andres Freund)

CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>relfrozenxid</TT
> value,
      allowing tuples to escape freezing, causing those rows to become
      invisible once 2^31 transactions have elapsed.  The probability of
      data loss is fairly low since multiple incorrect advancements would
      need to happen before actual loss occurs, but it's not zero.  In 9.2.0
      and later, the probability of loss is higher, and it's also possible
      to get <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"could not access status of transaction"</SPAN
> errors as a
      consequence of this bug.  Users upgrading from releases 9.0.4 or 8.4.8
      or earlier are not affected, but all later versions contain the bug.
     </P

CLASS="VARNAME"
>vacuum_freeze_table_age</TT
></A
>
      set to zero.  This will fix any latent corruption but will not be able
      to fix all pre-existing data errors.  However, an installation can be
      presumed safe after performing this vacuuming if it has executed fewer
      than 2^31 update transactions in its lifetime (check this with
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT txid_current() &#60; 2^31</TT
>).

      during hot standby startup (Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </P
><P
>      This bug can cause data loss on standby servers at the moment they
      start to accept hot-standby queries, by marking committed transactions
      as uncommitted. The likelihood of such corruption is small unless, at
      the time of standby startup, the primary server has executed many
      updating transactions since its last checkpoint.  Symptoms include
      missing rows, rows that should have been deleted being still visible,
      and obsolete versions of updated rows being still visible alongside
      their newer versions.
     </P
><P
>      This bug was introduced in versions 9.3.0, 9.2.5, 9.1.10, and 9.0.14.
      Standby servers that have only been running earlier releases are not
      at risk.  It's recommended that standby servers that have ever run any
      of the buggy releases be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a new
      base backup) after upgrading.
