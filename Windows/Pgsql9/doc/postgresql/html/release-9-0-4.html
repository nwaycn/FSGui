      uses for such a structure, they don't seem compelling enough to
      justify the effort required to make sure it always works safely.

      (Nikhil Sontakke)

      system index before locking the index's catalog.  This could deadlock
      against processes trying to acquire exclusive locks in the other,
      more standard order.
