>    This release of
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> adds features that have been requested
    for years, such as easy-to-use replication, a mass permission-changing
    facility, and anonymous code blocks. While past major releases have
    been conservative in their scope, this release shows a
    bold new desire to provide facilities that new and existing
    users of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> will embrace. This has all
    been done with few incompatibilities. Major enhancements include:
   </P

>      Built-in replication based on log shipping.  This advance consists of
      two features: Streaming Replication, allowing continuous archive
      (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>) files to be streamed over a network connection to a
      standby server, and Hot Standby, allowing continuous archive standby
      servers to execute read-only queries.  The net effect is to support a
      single master with multiple read-only slave servers.

       The most common use of exclusion constraints is to specify that column

       useful for time periods and other ranges, as well as arrays.
       This feature enhances checking of data integrity for many
       calendaring, time-management, and scientific applications.
