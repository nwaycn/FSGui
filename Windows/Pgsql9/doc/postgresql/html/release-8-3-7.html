>      Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails (Tom)
     </P
><P
>      This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
      related failure scenarios.  The previous fixes were narrowly tailored
      for the original problem reports, but we have now recognized that
      <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>any</I
></SPAN
> error thrown by an encoding conversion function could
      potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying to report the
      error.  The solution therefore is to disable translation and encoding
      conversion and report the plain-ASCII form of any error message,
      if we find we have gotten into a recursive error reporting situation.

> with the wrong encodings
      for the specified conversion function (Heikki)
     </P
><P
>      This prevents one possible scenario for encoding conversion failure.
      The previous change is a backstop to guard against other kinds of
      failures in the same area.

> to not modify the path expression unless
      necessary, and to make a saner attempt at it when necessary (Andrew)
     </P
><P
>      The SQL standard suggests that <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>xpath</CODE
> should work on data
      that is a document fragment, but <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libxml</SPAN
> doesn't support
      that, and indeed it's not clear that this is sensible according to the
      XPath standard.  <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>xpath</CODE
> attempted to work around this
      mismatch by modifying both the data and the path expression, but the
      modification was buggy and could cause valid searches to fail.  Now,
      <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>xpath</CODE
> checks whether the data is in fact a well-formed
      document, and if so invokes <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libxml</SPAN
> with no change to the
      data or path expression.  Otherwise, a different modification method
      that is somewhat less likely to fail is used.

>Note: </B
>       The new modification method is still not 100% satisfactory, and it
       seems likely that no real solution is possible.  This patch should
       therefore be viewed as a band-aid to keep from breaking existing
       applications unnecessarily.  It is likely that
       <SPAN

      ordinary database operation.  However, it could lead to unexpected
