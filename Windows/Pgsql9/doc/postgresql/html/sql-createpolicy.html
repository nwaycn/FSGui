><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE POLICY</TT

   security policy for a table.  Note that row-level security must be
   enabled on the table (using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL
   SECURITY</TT
>) in order for created policies to be applied.
  </P
><P
>   A policy grants the permission to select, insert, update, or delete rows
   that match the relevant policy expression.  Existing table rows are
   checked against the expression specified in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USING</TT
>,
   while new rows that would be created via <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT</TT
>
   or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPDATE</TT
> are checked against the expression specified
   in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH CHECK</TT
>.  When a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USING</TT
>
   expression returns true for a given row then that row is visible to the
   user, while if false or null is returned then the row is not visible.
   When a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH CHECK</TT
> expression returns true for a row
   then that row is inserted or updated, while if false or null is returned
   then an error occurs.
  </P
><P
>   For <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> statements,
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH CHECK</TT
> expressions are enforced after
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BEFORE</TT
> triggers are fired, and before any actual data
   modifications are made.  Thus a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BEFORE ROW</TT
> trigger may
   modify the data to be inserted, affecting the result of the security
   policy check.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH CHECK</TT
> expressions are enforced
   before any other constraints.
  </P
><P
>   Policy names are per-table.  Therefore, one policy name can be used for many
   different tables and have a definition for each table which is appropriate to
   that table.
  </P
><P
>   Policies can be applied for specific commands or for specific roles.  The
   default for newly created policies is that they apply for all commands and
   roles, unless otherwise specified.  If multiple policies apply to a given
   statement, they will be combined using OR (although <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON CONFLICT DO
   UPDATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT</TT
> policies are not combined in this way, but
   rather enforced as noted at each stage of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON CONFLICT</TT

  </P

>   While policies will be applied for explicit queries against tables
   in the database, they are not applied when the system is performing internal
   referential integrity checks or validating constraints.  This means there are
   indirect ways to determine that a given value exists.  An example of this is
   attempting to insert a duplicate value into a column that is a primary key
   or has a unique constraint.  If the insert fails then the user can infer that
   the value already exists. (This example assumes that the user is permitted by
   policy to insert records which they are not allowed to see.)  Another example
   is where a user is allowed to insert into a table which references another,
   otherwise hidden table.  Existence can be determined by the user inserting
   values into the referencing table, where success would indicate that the
   value exists in the referenced table.  These issues can be addressed by
   carefully crafting policies to prevent users from being able to insert,
   delete, or update records at all which might possibly indicate a value they
   are not otherwise able to see, or by using generated values (e.g., surrogate
   keys) instead of keys with external meanings.
  </P
><P
>   Generally, the system will enforce filter conditions imposed using
   security policies prior to qualifications that appear in user queries,
   in order to prevent inadvertent exposure of the protected data to
   user-defined functions which might not be trustworthy.  However,
   functions and operators marked by the system (or the system
   administrator) as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LEAKPROOF</TT
> may be evaluated before
   policy expressions, as they are assumed to be trustworthy.

>   Since policy expressions
   are added to the user's query directly, they will be run with the rights of
   the user running the overall query.  Therefore, users who are using a given
   policy must be able to access any tables or functions referenced in the
   expression or they will simply receive a permission denied error when
   attempting to query the table that has row-level security enabled.
   This does not change how views
   work, however.  As with normal queries and views, permission checks and
   policies for the tables which are referenced by a view will use the view
   owner's rights and any policies which apply to the view owner.
