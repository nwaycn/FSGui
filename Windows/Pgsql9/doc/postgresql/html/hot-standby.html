><P
>    Hot Standby is the term used to describe the ability to connect to
    the server and run read-only queries while the server is in archive
    recovery or standby mode. This
    is useful both for replication purposes and for restoring a backup
    to a desired state with great precision.
    The term Hot Standby also refers to the ability of the server to move
    from recovery through to normal operation while users continue running
    queries and/or keep their connections open.
   </P
><P
>    Running queries in hot standby mode is similar to normal query operation,
    though there are several usage and administrative differences
    explained below.

    brought the system to a consistent state.  All such connections are
    strictly read-only; not even temporary tables may be written.
   </P
><P
>    The data on the standby takes some time to arrive from the primary server
    so there will be a measurable delay between primary and standby. Running the
    same query nearly simultaneously on both primary and standby might therefore
    return differing results. We say that data on the standby is
    <I

    commit record for a transaction is replayed on the standby, the changes
    made by that transaction will be visible to any new snapshots taken on
    the standby.  Snapshots may be taken at the start of each query or at the
    start of each transaction, depending on the current transaction isolation
    level.  For more details, see <A

    potential for negative interactions or conflicts between them. The easiest

   </P

    user might choose to cancel either of the conflicting actions.  However,
    on the standby there is no choice: the WAL-logged action already occurred
    on the primary so the standby must not fail to apply it.  Furthermore,
    allowing WAL application to wait indefinitely may be very undesirable,
    because the standby's state will become increasingly far behind the
    primary's.  Therefore, a mechanism is provided to forcibly cancel standby
    queries that conflict with to-be-applied WAL records.
   </P
><P
>    An example of the problem situation is an administrator on the primary
    server running <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP TABLE</TT
> on a table that is currently being
    queried on the standby server.  Clearly the standby query cannot continue
    if the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP TABLE</TT
> is applied on the standby. If this situation
    occurred on the primary, the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP TABLE</TT
> would wait until the
    other query had finished. But when <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP TABLE</TT
> is run on the
    primary, the primary doesn't have information about what queries are
    running on the standby, so it will not wait for any such standby
    queries. The WAL change records come through to the standby while the
    standby query is still running, causing a conflict.  The standby server
    must either delay application of the WAL records (and everything after
    them, too) or else cancel the conflicting query so that the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP
    TABLE</TT
> can be applied.
   </P
><P
>    When a conflicting query is short, it's typically desirable to allow it to
    complete by delaying WAL application for a little bit; but a long delay in
    WAL application is usually not desirable.  So the cancel mechanism has
    parameters, <A
HREF="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-STANDBY-ARCHIVE-DELAY"
>max_standby_archive_delay</A
> and <A
HREF="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-STANDBY-STREAMING-DELAY"
>max_standby_streaming_delay</A
>, that define the maximum
    allowed delay in WAL application.  Conflicting queries will be canceled
    once it has taken longer than the relevant delay setting to apply any
    newly-received WAL data.  There are two parameters so that different delay
    values can be specified for the case of reading WAL data from an archive
    (i.e., initial recovery from a base backup or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"catching up"</SPAN
> a
    standby server that has fallen far behind) versus reading WAL data via
    streaming replication.
   </P
><P
>    In a standby server that exists primarily for high availability, it's
    best to set the delay parameters relatively short, so that the server
    cannot fall far behind the primary due to delays caused by standby
    queries.  However, if the standby server is meant for executing
    long-running queries, then a high or even infinite delay value may be
    preferable.  Keep in mind however that a long-running query could
    cause other sessions on the standby server to not see recent changes
    on the primary, if it delays application of WAL records.
   </P
><P

CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_standby_archive_delay</TT
> or
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_standby_streaming_delay</TT

    queries will be canceled.  This usually results just in a cancellation
    error, although in the case of replaying a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP DATABASE</TT
>
    the entire conflicting session will be terminated.  Also, if the conflict
    is over a lock held by an idle transaction, the conflicting session is
    terminated (this behavior might change in the future).
   </P
><P
>    Canceled queries may be retried immediately (after beginning a new
    transaction, of course).  Since query cancellation depends on
    the nature of the WAL records being replayed, a query that was
    canceled may well succeed if it is executed again.
   </P
><P
>    Keep in mind that the delay parameters are compared to the elapsed time
    since the WAL data was received by the standby server.  Thus, the grace
    period allowed to any one query on the standby is never more than the
    delay parameter, and could be considerably less if the standby has already
    fallen behind as a result of waiting for previous queries to complete, or
    as a result of being unable to keep up with a heavy update load.
   </P

    is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> allows
    cleanup of old row versions when there are no transactions that need to
    see them to ensure correct visibility of data according to MVCC rules.
    However, this rule can only be applied for transactions executing on the
    master.  So it is possible that cleanup on the master will remove row
    versions that are still visible to a transaction on the standby.
   </P
><P
>    Experienced users should note that both row version cleanup and row version
    freezing will potentially conflict with standby queries. Running a manual
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    no updated or deleted rows.
   </P
><P
>    Users should be clear that tables that are regularly and heavily updated
    on the primary server will quickly cause cancellation of longer running
    queries on the standby. In such cases the setting of a finite value for
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_standby_archive_delay</TT
> or
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"

   </P
><P
>    Remedial possibilities exist if the number of standby-query cancellations
    is found to be unacceptable.  The first option is to set the parameter
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>hot_standby_feedback</TT

CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> from
    removing recently-dead rows and so cleanup conflicts do not occur.
    If you do this, you
    should note that this will delay cleanup of dead rows on the primary,
    which may result in undesirable table bloat. However, the cleanup
    situation will be no worse than if the standby queries were running
    directly on the primary server, and you are still getting the benefit of
    off-loading execution onto the standby.
    If standby servers connect and disconnect frequently, you
    might want to make adjustments to handle the period when
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>hot_standby_feedback</TT
> feedback is not being provided.
    For example, consider increasing <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_standby_archive_delay</TT
>
    so that queries are not rapidly canceled by conflicts in WAL archive
    files during disconnected periods.  You should also consider increasing
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_standby_streaming_delay</TT
> to avoid rapid cancellations
    by newly-arrived streaming WAL entries after reconnection.
   </P
><P
>    Another option is to increase <A
HREF="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-VACUUM-DEFER-CLEANUP-AGE"
>vacuum_defer_cleanup_age</A
>
    on the primary server, so that dead rows will not be cleaned up as quickly
    as they normally would be.  This will allow more time for queries to
    execute before they are canceled on the standby, without having to set
    a high <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_standby_streaming_delay</TT
>.  However it is
    difficult to guarantee any specific execution-time window with this
    approach, since <TT

    transactions executed on the primary server.

    However, it may take some time for Hot Standby connections to be allowed,
    because the server will not accept connections until it has completed
    sufficient recovery to provide a consistent state against which queries
    can run.  During this period,
    clients that attempt to connect will be refused with an error message.
    To confirm the server has come up, either loop trying to connect from
    the application, or look for these messages in the server logs:

... then some time later ...

LOG:  consistent recovery state reached

    Consistency information is recorded once per checkpoint on the primary.
    It is not possible to enable hot standby when reading WAL

>    The setting of some parameters on the standby will need reconfiguration

>    Transaction status "hint bits" written on the primary are not WAL-logged,

    Thus, the standby server will still perform disk writes even though
    all users are read-only; no changes occur to the data values
    themselves.  Users will still write large sort temporary files and
    re-generate relcache info files, so no part of the database
    is truly read-only during hot standby mode.
    Note also that writes to remote databases using
    <SPAN

    database using PL functions will still be possible, even though the

    nothing happens to the connected user - they remain connected. The user cannot

    The stats file is deleted at the start of recovery, so stats from primary
    and standby will differ; this is considered a feature, not a bug.

>     Valid starting points for standby queries are generated at each
     checkpoint on the master. If the standby is shut down while the master
     is in a shutdown state, it might not be possible to re-enter Hot Standby
     until the primary is started up, so that it generates further starting
     points in the WAL logs.  This situation isn't a problem in the most
     common situations where it might happen. Generally, if the primary is
     shut down and not available anymore, that's likely due to a serious
     failure that requires the standby being converted to operate as
     the new primary anyway.  And in situations where the primary is
     being intentionally taken down, coordinating to make sure the standby
     becomes the new primary smoothly is also standard procedure.
