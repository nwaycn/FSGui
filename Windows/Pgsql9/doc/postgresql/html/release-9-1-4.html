CLASS="TYPE"

    from a previous major release by running <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

    you should run <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CREATE EXTENSION citext FROM unpackaged</TT

    to avoid collation-related failures in <TT

    The same is necessary if you restore a dump from a pre-9.1 database
    that contains an instance of the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>citext</TT
> data type.
    If you've already run the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    upgrading to 9.1.4, you will instead need to do manual catalog updates
    as explained in the third changelog item below.

      properly included in the DES hash.  Any stored password values that are
      affected by this bug will thus no longer match, so the stored values may
      need to be updated.  (CVE-2012-2143)

>      Release 9.1.2 provided a fix for collations of <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

      and indexes in databases upgraded or reloaded from pre-9.1
      installations, but that fix was incomplete: it neglected to handle arrays
      and domains over <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>citext</TT
>.  This release extends the module's
      upgrade script to handle these cases.  As before, if you have already
      run the upgrade script, you'll need to run the collation update
      commands by hand instead.  See the 9.1.2 release notes for more
      information about doing this.

      nullable side of an outer join of the surrounding query.
      In 9.1, queries affected by this bug would fail with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ERROR:
      Upper-level PlaceHolderVar found where not expected"</SPAN

      8.4, you'd silently get possibly-wrong answers, since the value

      either a table or column name of the query) were printed in an
      ambiguous way, risking that the view or rule would be interpreted
      differently after dump and reload.  Avoid the ambiguous case by
      attaching a no-op cast.
