     </P
><P
>      Recent <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> releases introduced mechanisms to
      protect against multixact wraparound, but some of that code did not
      account for the possibility that it would need to run during crash
      recovery, when the database may not be in a consistent state.  This
      could result in failure to restart after a crash, or failure to start
      up a secondary server.  The lingering effects of a previously-fixed
      bug in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_upgrade</SPAN
> could also cause such a failure, in
      installations that had used <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_upgrade</SPAN
> versions
      between 9.3.0 and 9.3.4.
     </P
><P
>      The <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_upgrade</SPAN
> bug in question was that it would
      set <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>oldestMultiXid</TT
> to 1 in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
> even
      if the true value should be higher.  With the fixes introduced in
      this release, such a situation will result in immediate emergency
      autovacuuming until a correct <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>oldestMultiXid</TT
> value can be
      determined.  If that would pose a hardship, users can avoid it by
      doing manual vacuuming <SPAN

      result in later sessions being unable to access that catalog at all.
      This is a very ancient bug, but it's so hard to trigger that no
      reproducible case had been seen until recently.

>      This type of plan is quite cheap when all the join clauses are used
      as index scan conditions, even if the inner scan would nominally
      fetch many rows, because the executor will stop after obtaining one
      row.  The planner only partially accounted for that effect, and would
      therefore overestimate the cost, leading it to possibly choose some
      other much less efficient plan type.
