    Local TCP/IP connections are not restricted by file-system permissions.

    The PostgreSQL server will accept any principal that is included in the keytab used by
    the server, but care needs to be taken to specify the correct principal details when
    making the connection from the client using the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>krbsrvname</TT
> connection parameter. (See
    also <A
HREF="libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS"
>Section 31.1.2</A

    changed from the default <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

> at build time using
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>./configure --with-krb-srvnam=</TT
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>whatever</I
></TT
>.
    In most environments,
    this parameter never needs to be changed.
    Some Kerberos implementations might require a different service name,
    such as Microsoft Active Directory which requires the service name
    to be in upper case (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>POSTGRES</TT

   </P

   </P

>    Client principals can be mapped to different <SPAN

    database user names with <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_ident.conf</TT

    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pgusername@realm</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>pgusername</TT

    Alternatively, you can use the full <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    the role name in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

   </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> also supports a parameter to strip the realm from
    the principal.  This method is supported for backwards compatibility and is
    strongly discouraged as it is then impossible to distinguish different users
    with the same user name but coming from different realms.  To enable this,
    set <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>include_realm</TT
> to 0.  For simple single-realm
    installations, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>include_realm</TT

    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>krb_realm</TT

    matches exactly what is in the <TT

    less capable option compared to specifying an explicit mapping in
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_ident.conf</TT

   </P
><P
>    Make sure that your server keytab file is readable (and preferably
    only readable) by the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server
    account.  (See also <A
HREF="postgres-user.html"
>Section 17.1</A
>.) The location
    of the key file is specified by the <A
HREF="runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-KRB-SERVER-KEYFILE"
>krb_server_keyfile</A
> configuration
    parameter. The default is
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/pgsql/etc/krb5.keytab</TT
> (or whatever
    directory was specified as <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>sysconfdir</TT
> at build time).
    For security reasons, it is recommended to use a separate keytab
    just for the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server rather
    than opening up permissions on the system keytab file.
   </P
><P

    Kerberos documentation for details. The following example is

    therefore only appropriate for closed networks where each client
    machine is under tight control and where the database and system
    administrators operate in close contact. In other words, you must
    trust the machine running the ident server.

>password</TT
> except that it uses LDAP
    as the password verification method. LDAP is used only to validate
    the user name/password pairs. Therefore the user must already

   </P
><P
>    LDAP authentication can operate in two modes. In the first mode,
    which we will call the simple bind mode,
    the server will bind to the distinguished name constructed as
    <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>prefix</I
></TT
> <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>username</I
></TT
> <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>suffix</I
></TT
>.
    Typically, the <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>prefix</I
></TT
> parameter is used to specify
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cn=</TT
>, or <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>DOMAIN</I
></TT
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\</TT
> in an Active
    Directory environment.  <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>suffix</I
></TT
> is used to specify the
    remaining part of the DN in a non-Active Directory environment.
   </P
><P
>    In the second mode, which we will call the search+bind mode,
    the server first binds to the LDAP directory with
    a fixed user name and password, specified with <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>ldapbinddn</I
></TT
>
    and <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>ldapbindpasswd</I
></TT
>, and performs a search for the user trying
    to log in to the database. If no user and password is configured, an
    anonymous bind will be attempted to the directory. The search will be
    performed over the subtree at <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>ldapbasedn</I
></TT
>, and will try to
    do an exact match of the attribute specified in
    <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>ldapsearchattribute</I
></TT
>.
    Once the user has been found in
    this search, the server disconnects and re-binds to the directory as
    this user, using the password specified by the client, to verify that the
    login is correct. This mode is the same as that used by LDAP authentication
    schemes in other software, such as Apache <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mod_authnz_ldap</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pam_ldap</TT
>.
    This method allows for significantly more flexibility
    in where the user objects are located in the directory, but will cause
    two separate connections to the LDAP server to be made.
