>   At all times, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>write ahead log</I

CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
>
   subdirectory of the cluster's data directory. The log records
   every change made to the database's data files.  This log exists
   primarily for crash-safety purposes: if the system crashes, the
   database can be restored to consistency by <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"replaying"</SPAN
> the
   log entries made since the last checkpoint.  However, the existence
   of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up
   databases: we can combine a file-system-level backup with backup of
   the WAL files.  If recovery is needed, we restore the file system backup and
   then replay from the backed-up WAL files to bring the system to a
   current state.  This approach is more complex to administer than
   either of the previous approaches, but it has some significant
   benefits:
  <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>     We do not need a perfectly consistent file system backup as the starting point.
     Any internal inconsistency in the backup will be corrected by log
     replay (this is not significantly different from what happens during
     crash recovery).  So we do not need a file system snapshot capability,
     just <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>tar</SPAN

    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     Since we can combine an indefinitely long sequence of WAL files
     for replay, continuous backup can be achieved simply by continuing to archive
     the WAL files.  This is particularly valuable for large databases, where
     it might not be convenient to take a full backup frequently.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     It is not necessary to replay the WAL entries all the
     way to the end.  We could stop the replay at any point and have a
     consistent snapshot of the database as it was at that time.  Thus,
     this technique supports <I

   have to be archived.  Still, it is the preferred backup technique in
   many situations where high reliability is needed.

>    In an abstract sense, a running <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> system
    produces an indefinitely long sequence of WAL records.  The system
    physically divides this sequence into WAL <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>segment
    files</I
>, which are normally 16MB apiece (although the segment size
    can be altered when building <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    files are given numeric names that reflect their position in the
    abstract WAL sequence.  When not using WAL archiving, the system
    normally creates just a few segment files and then
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"recycles"</SPAN

    to higher segment numbers.  It's assumed that segment files whose
    contents precede the checkpoint-before-last are no longer of
    interest and can be recycled.
   </P
><P
>    When archiving WAL data, we need to capture the contents of each segment
    file once it is filled, and save that data somewhere before the segment
    file is recycled for reuse.  Depending on the application and the
    available hardware, there could be many different ways of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"saving
    the data somewhere"</SPAN
>: we could copy the segment files to an NFS-mounted
    directory on another machine, write them onto a tape drive (ensuring that
    you have a way of identifying the original name of each file), or batch
    them together and burn them onto CDs, or something else entirely.  To
    provide the database administrator with flexibility,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> tries not to make any assumptions about how
    the archiving will be done.  Instead, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> lets
    the administrator specify a shell command to be executed to copy a
    completed segment file to wherever it needs to go.  The command could be
    as simple as a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cp</TT
>, or it could invoke a complex shell
    script &mdash; it's all up to you.
   </P

    Use <TT

    which will copy archivable WAL segments to the directory
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/server/archivedir</TT

    recommendation, and might not work on all platforms.)  After the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%p</TT

    the actual command executed might look like this:

    A similar command will be generated for each new file to be archived.
   </P
><P
>    The archive command will be executed under the ownership of the same
    user that the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server is running as.  Since
    the series of WAL files being archived contains effectively everything
    in your database, you will want to be sure that the archived data is
    protected from prying eyes; for example, archive into a directory that
    does not have group or world read access.
   </P
><P
>    It is important that the archive command return zero exit status if and
    only if it succeeds.  Upon getting a zero result,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    successfully archived, and will remove or recycle it.  However, a nonzero
    status tells <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> that the file was not archived;
    it will try again periodically until it succeeds.
   </P
><P
>    The archive command should generally be designed to refuse to overwrite
    any pre-existing archive file.  This is an important safety feature to
    preserve the integrity of your archive in case of administrator error
    (such as sending the output of two different servers to the same archive
    directory).
   </P
><P
>    It is advisable to test your proposed archive command to ensure that it
    indeed does not overwrite an existing file, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>and that it returns
    nonzero status in this case</I
></SPAN

    The example command above for Unix ensures this by including a separate
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>test</TT
> step.  On some Unix platforms, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cp</TT
> has
    switches such as <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-i</TT
> that can be used to do the same thing
    less verbosely, but you should not rely on these without verifying that
    the right exit status is returned.  (In particular, GNU <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cp</TT
>
    will return status zero when <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-i</TT
> is used and the target file
    already exists, which is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
> the desired behavior.)
   </P
><P
>    While designing your archiving setup, consider what will happen if
    the archive command fails repeatedly because some aspect requires
    operator intervention or the archive runs out of space. For example, this
    could occur if you write to tape without an autochanger; when the tape
    fills, nothing further can be archived until the tape is swapped.
    You should ensure that any error condition or request to a human operator
    is reported appropriately so that the situation can be
    resolved reasonably quickly. The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
> directory will
    continue to fill with WAL segment files until the situation is resolved.
    (If the file system containing <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
> fills up,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> will do a PANIC shutdown.  No committed
    transactions will be lost, but the database will remain offline until
    you free some space.)
   </P
><P
>    The speed of the archiving command is unimportant as long as it can keep up
    with the average rate at which your server generates WAL data.  Normal
    operation continues even if the archiving process falls a little behind.
    If archiving falls significantly behind, this will increase the amount of
    data that would be lost in the event of a disaster. It will also mean that
    the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
> directory will contain large numbers of
    not-yet-archived segment files, which could eventually exceed available
    disk space. You are advised to monitor the archiving process to ensure that
    it is working as you intend.
   </P
><P
>    In writing your archive command, you should assume that the file names to
    be archived can be up to 64 characters long and can contain any
    combination of ASCII letters, digits, and dots.  It is not necessary to
    preserve the original relative path (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%p</TT
>) but it is necessary to
    preserve the file name (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%f</TT
>).
   </P
><P
>    Note that although WAL archiving will allow you to restore any
    modifications made to the data in your <SPAN

    it will not restore changes made to configuration files (that is,
    <TT

    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_ident.conf</TT

    than through SQL operations.
    You might wish to keep the configuration files in a location that will
    be backed up by your regular file system backup procedures.  See
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-file-locations.html"
>Section 18.2</A
> for how to relocate the
    configuration files.
   </P
><P
>    The archive command is only invoked on completed WAL segments.  Hence,
    if your server generates only little WAL traffic (or has slack periods
    where it does so), there could be a long delay between the completion
    of a transaction and its safe recording in archive storage.  To put
    a limit on how old unarchived data can be, you can set
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-TIMEOUT"
>archive_timeout</A
> to force the server to switch
    to a new WAL segment file at least that often.  Note that archived
    files that are archived early due to a forced switch are still the same
    length as completely full files.  It is therefore unwise to set a very
    short <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_timeout</TT
> &mdash; it will bloat your archive
    storage.  <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_timeout</TT

    usually reasonable.
   </P
><P
>    Also, you can force a segment switch manually with
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_switch_xlog</CODE

    just-finished transaction is archived as soon as possible.  Other utility
    functions related to WAL management are listed in <A
HREF="functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-BACKUP-TABLE"

   </P

    are optimized to avoid WAL logging, as described in <A
HREF="populate.html#POPULATE-PITR"
>Section 14.4.7</A
>.  If archiving or streaming replication were
    turned on during execution of one of these statements, WAL would not
    contain enough information for archive recovery.  (Crash recovery is
    unaffected.)  For this reason, <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>wal_level</TT

    server start.  However, <TT

    effectively forced on during backup mode.
   </P
><P
>    To make use of the backup, you will need to keep all the WAL
    segment files generated during and after the file system backup.
    To aid you in doing this, the base backup process
    creates a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>backup history file</I
> that is immediately
    stored into the WAL archive area. This file is named after the first
    WAL segment file that you need for the file system backup.
    For example, if the starting WAL file is
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0000000100001234000055CD</TT
> the backup history file will be
    named something like
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0000000100001234000055CD.007C9330.backup</TT
>. (The second
    part of the file name stands for an exact position within the WAL
    file, and can ordinarily be ignored.) Once you have safely archived
    the file system backup and the WAL segment files used during the
    backup (as specified in the backup history file), all archived WAL
    segments with names numerically less are no longer needed to recover
    the file system backup and can be deleted. However, you should
    consider keeping several backup sets to be absolutely certain that
    you can recover your data.
   </P
><P
>    The backup history file is just a small text file. It contains the
    label string you gave to <A
HREF="app-pgbasebackup.html"
>pg_basebackup</A
>, as well as
    the starting and ending times and WAL segments of the backup.
    If you used the label to identify the associated dump file,
    then the archived history file is enough to tell you which dump file to
    restore.
   </P
><P
>    Since you have to keep around all the archived WAL files back to your
    last base backup, the interval between base backups should usually be
    chosen based on how much storage you want to expend on archived WAL
    files.  You should also consider how long you are prepared to spend
    recovering, if recovery should be necessary &mdash; the system will have to
    replay all those WAL segments, and that could take awhile if it has

    When taking a base backup of an active database, this situation is normal
    and not an error.  However, you need to ensure that you can distinguish
    complaints of this sort from real errors.  For example, some versions
    of <SPAN

    <SPAN

    the clients that are using those replication slots will still be connecting

    not overwrite the WAL data generated by previous timelines.  It is
    in fact possible to archive many different timelines.  While that might
    seem like a useless feature, it's often a lifesaver.  Consider the
    situation where you aren't quite sure what point-in-time to recover to,
    and so have to do several point-in-time recoveries by trial and error
    until you find the best place to branch off from the old history.  Without
    timelines this process would soon generate an unmanageable mess.  With
    timelines, you can recover to <SPAN

    archive area just like WAL segment files.  The history files are just
    small text files, so it's cheap and appropriate to keep them around
    indefinitely (unlike the segment files which are large).  You can, if
    you like, add comments to a history file to record your own notes about
    how and why this particular timeline was created.  Such comments will be
    especially valuable when you have a thicket of different timelines as
    a result of experimentation.

>     Operations on hash indexes are not presently WAL-logged, so
     replay will not update these indexes.  This will mean that any new inserts
     will be ignored by the index, updated rows will apparently disappear and
     deleted rows will still retain pointers. In other words, if you modify a
     table with a hash index on it then you will get incorrect query results
     on a standby server.  When recovery completes it is recommended that you
     manually <A

     each such index after completing a recovery operation.

     command is executed while a base backup is being taken, and then
     the template database that the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE DATABASE</TT

     is modified while the base backup is still in progress, it is
     possible that recovery will cause those modifications to be
     propagated into the created database as well.  This is of course
     undesirable.  To avoid this risk, it is best not to modify any
     template databases while taking a base backup.

     commands are WAL-logged with the literal absolute path, and will
     therefore be replayed as tablespace creations with the same
     absolute path.  This might be undesirable if the log is being
     replayed on a different machine.  It can be dangerous even if the
     log is being replayed on the same machine, but into a new data
     directory: the replay will still overwrite the contents of the
     original tablespace.  To avoid potential gotchas of this sort,
     the best practice is to take a new base backup after creating or
     dropping tablespaces.

>    It should also be noted that the default <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

    format is fairly bulky since it includes many disk page snapshots.
    These page snapshots are designed to support crash recovery, since
    we might need to fix partially-written disk pages.  Depending on
    your system hardware and software, the risk of partial writes might
    be small enough to ignore, in which case you can significantly
    reduce the total volume of archived logs by turning off page
    snapshots using the <A
HREF="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FULL-PAGE-WRITES"
>full_page_writes</A
>
    parameter.  (Read the notes and warnings in <A
HREF="wal.html"
>Chapter 29</A
>
    before you do so.)  Turning off page snapshots does not prevent
    use of the logs for PITR operations.  An area for future
    development is to compress archived WAL data by removing
    unnecessary page copies even when <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>full_page_writes</TT
> is
    on.  In the meantime, administrators might wish to reduce the number
    of page snapshots included in WAL by increasing the checkpoint
    interval parameters as much as feasible.
