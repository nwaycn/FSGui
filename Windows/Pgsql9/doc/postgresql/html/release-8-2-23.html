      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint.  That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that it
      depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.

      merely upgrading will not fix the problem.  If you need to fix this

      <TT

      to be fixed.

      attempts to copy its data verbatim to another table could produce

      The problem can only manifest in this precise form in 8.4 and later,
      but we patched earlier versions as well in case there are other code
      paths that could trigger the same bug.

>      Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support

     </P
><P
>      For a cascading foreign key that references its own table, a row update
      will fire both the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON UPDATE</TT
> trigger and the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CHECK</TT
> trigger as one event.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON UPDATE</TT
>
      trigger must execute first, else the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CHECK</TT
> will check a
      non-final state of the row and possibly throw an inappropriate error.
      However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their
      names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have
      auto-generated names following the convention
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN"</SPAN
>.  A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases.  So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers.  Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its
      triggers into the right order.
