>    The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> standard defines four levels of
    transaction isolation.  The most strict is Serializable,
    which is defined by the standard in a paragraph which says that any
    concurrent execution of a set of Serializable transactions is guaranteed
    to produce the same effect as running them one at a time in some order.
    The other three levels are defined in terms of phenomena, resulting from
    interaction between concurrent transactions, which must not occur at
    each level.  The standard notes that due to the definition of
    Serializable, none of these phenomena are possible at that level.  (This
    is hardly surprising -- if the effect of the transactions must be
    consistent with having been run one at a time, how could you see any
    phenomena caused by interactions?)

    in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows
    that were committed as of the command start time.  However, such a target
    row might have already been updated (or deleted or locked) by
    another concurrent transaction by the time it is found.  In this case, the
    would-be updater will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or
    roll back (if it is still in progress).  If the first updater rolls back,
    then its effects are negated and the second updater can proceed with
    updating the originally found row.  If the first updater commits, the
    second updater will ignore the row if the first updater deleted it,
    otherwise it will attempt to apply its operation to the updated version of
    the row.  The search condition of the command (the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause) is
    re-evaluated to see if the updated version of the row still matches the
    search condition.  If so, the second updater proceeds with its operation
    using the updated version of the row.  In the case of
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT FOR UPDATE</TT

   </P
><P

CLASS="COMMAND"

    behaves similarly. In Read Committed mode, each row proposed for insertion
    will either insert or update. Unless there are unrelated errors, one of
    those two outcomes is guaranteed.  If a conflict originates in another
    transaction whose effects are not yet visible to the <TT

    </TT

    the case in Read Committed mode.
   </P
><P
>    Because of the above rules, it is possible for an updating command to see
    an inconsistent snapshot: it can see the effects of concurrent updating
    commands on the same rows it is trying to update, but it
    does not see effects of those commands on other rows in the database.
    This behavior makes Read Committed mode unsuitable for commands that
    involve complex search conditions; however, it is just right for simpler
    cases.  For example, consider updating bank balances with transactions
    like:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 7534;
COMMIT;</PRE
><P>

    If two such transactions concurrently try to change the balance of account
    12345, we clearly want the second transaction to start with the updated
    version of the account's row.  Because each command is affecting only a
    predetermined row, letting it see the updated version of the row does
    not create any troublesome inconsistency.
   </P
><P
>    More complex usage can produce undesirable results in Read Committed
    mode.  For example, consider a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> command
    operating on data that is being both added and removed from its
    restriction criteria by another command, e.g., assume
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>website</TT
> is a two-row table with
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>website.hits</TT
> equaling <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>9</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>10</TT
>:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>BEGIN;
UPDATE website SET hits = hits + 1;
-- run from another session:  DELETE FROM website WHERE hits = 10;
COMMIT;</PRE
><P>

    The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> will have no effect even though
    there is a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>website.hits = 10</TT
> row before and
    after the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>. This occurs because the
    pre-update row value <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>9</TT
> is skipped, and when the
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> completes and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
>
    obtains a lock, the new row value is no longer <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>10</TT
> but
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>11</TT
>, which no longer matches the criteria.
   </P
><P
>    Because Read Committed mode starts each command with a new snapshot
    that includes all transactions committed up to that instant,
    subsequent commands in the same transaction will see the effects
    of the committed concurrent transaction in any case.  The point

    For example, even a read only transaction at this level may see a

    as if transactions had been executed one after another, serially,

    execution of a concurrent set of serializable transactions behave
    in a manner inconsistent with all possible serial (one at a time)
    executions of those transactions.  This monitoring does not
    introduce any blocking beyond that present in repeatable read, but
    there is some overhead to the monitoring, and detection of the
    conditions which could cause a

    Suppose that serializable transaction A computes:

    transaction B computes:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

    and obtains the result 300, which it inserts in a new row with
    <TT

    If either transaction were running at the Repeatable Read isolation level,
    both would be allowed to commit; but since there is no serial order of execution
    consistent with the result, using Serializable transactions will allow one
    transaction to commit and will roll the other back with this message:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>ERROR:  could not serialize access due to read/write dependencies among transactions</PRE
><P>

    This is because if A had
    executed before B, B would have computed the sum 330, not 300, and
    similarly the other order would have resulted in a different sum
    computed by A.
   </P
><P
>    When relying on Serializable transactions to prevent anomalies, it is
    important that any data read from a permanent user table not be

    data read within a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>deferrable</I

    transaction is known to be valid as soon as it is read, because such a
    transaction waits until it can acquire a snapshot guaranteed to be free
    from such problems before starting to read any data.  In all other cases
    applications must not depend on results read during a transaction that
    later aborted; instead, they should retry the transaction until it

    acquired during execution of a query will depend on the plan used by
    the query, and multiple finer-grained locks (e.g., tuple locks) may be
    combined into fewer coarser-grained locks (e.g., page locks) during the
    course of the transaction to prevent exhaustion of the memory used to
    track the locks.  A <TT

    the <SPAN

    Repeatable Read transactions don't.)  On the other hand, SIRead locks
    often need to be kept past transaction commit, until overlapping read
    write transactions complete.

>    Consistent use of Serializable transactions can simplify development.
    The guarantee that any set of concurrent serializable transactions will
    have the same effect as if they were run one at a time means that if
    you can demonstrate that a single transaction, as written, will do the
    right thing when run by itself, you can have confidence that it will
    do the right thing in any mix of serializable transactions, even without
    any information about what those other transactions might do.  It is
    important that an environment which uses this technique have a
    generalized way of handling serialization failures (which always return
    with a SQLSTATE value of '40001'), because it will be very hard to
    predict exactly which transactions might contribute to the read/write
    dependencies and need to be rolled back to prevent serialization
    anomalies.  The monitoring of read/write dependencies has a cost, as does
    the restart of transactions which are terminated with a serialization
    failure, but balanced against the cost and blocking involved in use of
    explicit locks and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT FOR UPDATE</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT FOR
    SHARE</TT
>, Serializable transactions are the best performance choice
    for some environments.
