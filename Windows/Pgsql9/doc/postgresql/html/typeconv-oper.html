The <SPAN

array inclusion (<TT

Since none of these polymorphic pseudo-types (see <A
HREF="datatype-pseudo.html"
>Section 8.20</A
>) are considered preferred, the parser cannot
resolve the ambiguity on that basis.
However, <A
HREF="typeconv-oper.html#OP-RESOL-LAST-UNKNOWN"
>step 3.f</A
> tells
it to assume that the unknown-type literal is of the same type as the other
input, that is, integer array.  Now only one of the two operators can match,
so array inclusion is selected.  (Had range inclusion been selected, we would
have gotten an error, because the string does not have the right format to be
a range literal.)</P

>Example 10-5. Custom Operator on a Domain Type</B
></P
><P
>Users sometimes try to declare operators applying just to a domain type.
This is possible but is not nearly as useful as it might seem, because the
operator resolution rules are designed to select operators applying to the
domain's base type.  As an example consider
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>CREATE DOMAIN mytext AS text CHECK(...);
CREATE FUNCTION mytext_eq_text (mytext, text) RETURNS boolean AS ...;
CREATE OPERATOR = (procedure=mytext_eq_text, leftarg=mytext, rightarg=text);
CREATE TABLE mytable (val mytext);

SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE val = 'foo';</PRE
><P>
This query will not use the custom operator.  The parser will first see if
there is a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>mytext</TT
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
> <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>mytext</TT
> operator
(<A
HREF="typeconv-oper.html#OP-RESOL-EXACT-UNKNOWN"
>step 2.a</A
>), which there is not;
then it will consider the domain's base type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
>, and see if
there is a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
> <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> operator
(<A
HREF="typeconv-oper.html#OP-RESOL-EXACT-DOMAIN"
>step 2.b</A
>), which there is;
so it resolves the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>unknown</TT
>-type literal as <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> and
uses the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
> <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> operator.
The only way to get the custom operator to be used is to explicitly cast
the literal:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE val = text 'foo';</PRE
><P>
so that the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>mytext</TT
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
> <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> operator is found
immediately according to the exact-match rule.  If the best-match rules
are reached, they actively discriminate against operators on domain types.
If they did not, such an operator would create too many ambiguous-operator
failures, because the casting rules always consider a domain as castable
to or from its base type, and so the domain operator would be considered
usable in all the same cases as a similarly-named operator on the base type.</P
