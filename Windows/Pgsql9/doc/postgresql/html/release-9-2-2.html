      allowed incorrect indexing decisions to be made during the initial
      phase of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</TT

      by that command could be corrupt.  It is recommended that indexes
      built in 9.2.X with <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</TT
> be rebuilt
      after applying this update.
     </P
><P

      in-place updates when changing the state of an index's
      <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"

      cause concurrent sessions to miss updating the target index, thus
      again resulting in corrupt concurrently-created indexes.

      <TT

      on the table before corrective action can be taken to fix or remove
      the invalid index.

     </P
><P

      execution led to some anomalous behaviors not seen in previous
      releases, because execution would proceed with a snapshot acquired
      before locking the tables used by the query.  Thus, for example,
      a query would not be guaranteed to see updates committed by a
      preceding transaction even if that transaction had exclusive lock.
      We'll probably revisit this in future releases, but meanwhile put it
      back the way it was before 9.2.
