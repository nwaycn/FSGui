      prevent the grantee from adding or removing members from the granted
      role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by doing <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SET

      revoke the access of others, contrary to the wishes of his grantor.
      Unapproved role member additions are a lesser concern, since an
      uncooperative role member could provide most of his rights to others
      anyway by creating views or <TT

>      Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator
      functions (Andres Freund)
     </P
><P
>      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
      during <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE FUNCTION</TT
>, but they are also normal SQL
      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

      activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
      than other parts.  At least in the case of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX</TT
>,
      this can be used to cause the permissions checks to be performed
      against a different table than the index creation, allowing for a
      privilege escalation attack.

      in <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

      functions were more careful about avoiding buffer overrun, the limit
      was short enough to cause them to reject some valid inputs, such as
      input containing a very long timezone name.  The <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

      (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)
     </P

      allocation size without checking for overflow.  If overflow did
      occur, a too-small buffer would be allocated and then written past.

> and related functions to provide a clear
      guarantee that fixed-size buffers are not overrun.  Unlike the
      preceding items, it is unclear whether these cases really represent
      live issues, since in most cases there appear to be previous
      constraints on the size of the input string.  Nonetheless it seems
      prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of this type.

      could connect to it as database superuser, and then potentially
      exploit the privileges of the operating-system user who started the
      tests.  A future release will probably incorporate changes in the
      testing procedure to prevent this risk, but some public discussion is
      needed first.  So for the moment, just warn people against using
      <TT
