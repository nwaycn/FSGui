  Such processes are started, stopped and monitored by <TT

  which permits them to have a lifetime closely linked to the server's status.
  These processes have the option to attach to <SPAN

  shared memory area and to connect to databases internally; they can also run
  multiple transactions serially, just like a regular client-connected server
  process.  Also, by linking to <SPAN

   it will be automatically unregistered by the postmaster on exit.
   Otherwise, it will be restarted after the time period configured via
   <TT

   reinitializes the cluster due to a backend failure.  Backends which need
   to suspend execution only temporarily should use an interruptible sleep

   <TT

   argument to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>RegisterDynamicBackgroundWorker</CODE

   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

   <TT

>BGWH_STOPPED</TT

   no longer running; and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BGWH_STARTED</TT

   currently running.  In this last case, the PID will also be returned via the
   second argument.
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>TerminateBackgroundWorker</CODE
> causes the postmaster to send
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SIGTERM</TT

   as soon as it is not.
  </P
><P
>   In some cases, a process which registers a background worker may wish to
   wait for the worker to start up.  This can be accomplished by initializing
   <TT

   This function will block until the postmaster has attempted to start the
   background worker, or until the postmaster dies.  If the background runner
   is running, the return value will <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BGWH_STARTED</TT

   the PID will be written to the provided address.  Otherwise, the return
