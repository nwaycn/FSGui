>  <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SP-GiST</ACRONYM
> offers an interface with a high level of
  abstraction, requiring the access method developer to implement only
  methods specific to a given data type. The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SP-GiST</ACRONYM
> core
  is responsible for efficient disk mapping and searching the tree structure.
  It also takes care of concurrency and logging considerations.
 </P
><P
>  Leaf tuples of an <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SP-GiST</ACRONYM
> tree contain values of the
  same data type as the indexed column.  Leaf tuples at the root level will
  always contain the original indexed data value, but leaf tuples at lower
  levels might contain only a compressed representation, such as a suffix.
  In that case the operator class support functions must be able to
  reconstruct the original value using information accumulated from the
  inner tuples that are passed through to reach the leaf level.
 </P
><P
>  Inner tuples are more complex, since they are branching points in the
  search tree.  Each inner tuple contains a set of one or more
  <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>nodes</I
>, which represent groups of similar leaf values.
  A node contains a downlink that leads to either another, lower-level inner
  tuple, or a short list of leaf tuples that all lie on the same index page.
  Each node has a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>label</I
> that describes it; for example,
  in a radix tree the node label could be the next character of the string
  value.  Optionally, an inner tuple can have a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>prefix</I
> value
  that describes all its members.  In a radix tree this could be the common
  prefix of the represented strings.  The prefix value is not necessarily
  really a prefix, but can be any data needed by the operator class;
  for example, in a quad-tree it can store the central point that the four
  quadrants are measured with respect to.  A quad-tree inner tuple would
  then also contain four nodes corresponding to the quadrants around this
  central point.
 </P
><P
>  Some tree algorithms require knowledge of level (or depth) of the current
  tuple, so the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SP-GiST</ACRONYM
> core provides the possibility for
  operator classes to manage level counting while descending the tree.
  There is also support for incrementally reconstructing the represented
  value when that is needed.

   Although <ACRONYM

   in indexed columns, this is hidden from the index operator class code:
   no null index entries or search conditions will ever be passed to the

       This action moves all the existing nodes into a new lower-level

       have the same meaning as the original prefix, because there is
       no opportunity to alter the node labels that are moved to the new
       lower-level tuple, nor to change any child index entries.
       After the node has been split, the <CODE

       That call will usually result in an <TT

       since presumably the node label added in the split step will not
       match the new value; so after that, there will be a third call

       The array <TT

       describes the index search condition(s).  These conditions are

       them are interesting.  (Note that <TT

       that all index entries satisfy the query.)  Usually the consistent

       <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>sk_argument</TT

       respectively give the indexable operator and comparison value.
       In particular it is not necessary to check <TT

       see if the comparison value is NULL, because the SP-GiST core code
       will filter out such conditions.

       <TT

       inner tuple, and
       <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"

       If the operator class keeps track of levels, set
       <TT

>levelAdds</TT

       required when descending to each node to be visited.  (Often these
       increments will be the same for all the nodes, but that's not

       If value reconstruction is needed, set
       <TT

       reconstructed for each child node to be visited; otherwise, leave
