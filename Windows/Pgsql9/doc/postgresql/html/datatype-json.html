  the JSON data types have the advantage of enforcing that each

  <TT

 </P
><P
>  Because the <TT

  will preserve semantically-insignificant white space between tokens, as
  well as the order of keys within JSON objects. Also, if a JSON object
  within the value contains the same key more than once, all the key/value
  pairs are kept.  (The processing functions consider the last value as the
  operative one.)  By contrast, <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>jsonb</TT

  space, does not preserve the order of object keys, and does not keep
  duplicate object keys.  If duplicate keys are specified in the input,
  only the last value is kept.
 </P

  legacy assumptions about ordering of object keys.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

  encoding per database.  It is therefore not possible for the JSON
  types to conform rigidly to the JSON specification unless the database
  encoding is UTF8. Attempts to directly include characters that
  cannot be represented in the database encoding will fail; conversely,
  characters that can be represented in the database encoding but not
  in UTF8 will be allowed.

  function for the <TT

  regardless of the database encoding, and are checked only for syntactic
  correctness (that is, that four hex digits follow <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

  However, the input function for <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

  Unicode escapes for non-ASCII characters (those above <TT

  unless the database encoding is UTF8.  The <TT

  that any use of Unicode surrogate pairs to designate characters outside
  the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane be correct.  Valid Unicode escapes
  are converted to the equivalent ASCII or UTF8 character for storage;
  this includes folding surrogate pairs into a single character.

>   Representing data as JSON can be considerably more flexible than
   the traditional relational data model, which is compelling in
   environments where requirements are fluid.  It is quite possible
   for both approaches to co-exist and complement each other within
   the same application.  However, even for applications where maximal
   flexibility is desired, it is still recommended that JSON documents
   have a somewhat fixed structure.  The structure is typically
   unenforced (though enforcing some business rules declaratively is
   possible), but having a predictable structure makes it easier to write
   queries that usefully summarize a set of <SPAN

   considerations as any other data type when stored in a table.
   Although storing large documents is practicable, keep in mind that
   any update acquires a row-level lock on the whole row.
   Consider limiting JSON documents to a
   manageable size in order to decrease lock contention among updating
   transactions.  Ideally, JSON documents should each
   represent an atomic datum that business rules dictate cannot
   reasonably be further subdivided into smaller datums that
   could be modified independently.

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>-- Find documents in which the key "tags" contains array element "qui"
SELECT jdoc-&gt;'guid', jdoc-&gt;'name' FROM api WHERE jdoc @&gt; '{"tags": ["qui"]}';</PRE
><P>
    A simple GIN index on the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>jdoc</TT
> column can support this
    query.  But note that such an index will store copies of every key and
    value in the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>jdoc</TT
> column, whereas the expression index
    of the previous example stores only data found under
    the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tags</TT
> key.  While the simple-index approach is far more
    flexible (since it supports queries about any key), targeted expression
    indexes are likely to be smaller and faster to search than a simple
    index.

CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT

    only queries with the <TT

>@&gt;</TT

    performance advantages over the default operator
    class <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

CLASS="LITERAL"

    index is usually much smaller than a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    index over the same data, and the specificity of searches is better,
    particularly when queries contain keys that appear frequently in the
    data.  Therefore search operations typically perform better
    than with the default operator class.

    Basically, each <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT
> index item is
    a hash of the value and the key(s) leading to it; for example to index
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>{"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}</TT
>, a single index item would
    be created incorporating all three of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>bar</TT
>,
    and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baz</TT
> into the hash value.  Thus a containment query
    looking for this structure would result in an extremely specific index
    search; but there is no way at all to find out whether <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>
    appears as a key.  On the other hand, a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_ops</TT
>
    index would create three index items representing <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>,
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>bar</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baz</TT
> separately; then to do the
    containment query, it would look for rows containing all three of
    these items.  While GIN indexes can perform such an AND search fairly
    efficiently, it will still be less specific and slower than the
    equivalent <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT
> search, especially if
    there are a very large number of rows containing any single one of the
    three index items.
  </P
><P
>    A disadvantage of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT
> approach is
    that it produces no index entries for JSON structures not containing
    any values, such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>{"a": {}}</TT
>.  If a search for
    documents containing such a structure is requested, it will require a
    full-index scan, which is quite slow.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jsonb_path_ops</TT
> is
    therefore ill-suited for applications that often perform such searches.

      Note that object keys are compared in their storage order;
      in particular, since shorter keys are stored before longer keys, this
      can lead to results that might be unintuitive, such as:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>{ "aa": 1, "c": 1} &#62; {"b": 1, "d": 1}</PRE
