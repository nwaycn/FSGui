>   Client authentication is controlled by a configuration file,
   which traditionally is named
   <TT

>pg_hba.conf</TT

   cluster's data directory.
   (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

   <TT

  </P
><P
>   The general format of the <TT

>pg_hba.conf</TT
> file is
   a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any
   text after the <TT

>#</TT

   Records cannot be continued across lines.
   A record is made
   up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
   Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted.
   Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g.,
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>all</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>replication</TT
>) makes the word lose its special
   meaning, and just match a database, user, or host with that name.
  </P
><P
>   Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range
   (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a user name,
   and the authentication method to be used for connections matching
   these parameters. The first record with a matching connection type,
   client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform
   authentication. There is no <SPAN

   fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches,

>        Users sometimes wonder why host names are handled
        in this seemingly complicated way, with two name resolutions
        including a reverse lookup of the client's IP address.  This
        complicates use of the feature in case the client's reverse DNS
        entry is not set up or yields some undesirable host name.
        It is done primarily for efficiency: this way, a connection attempt
        requires at most two resolver lookups, one reverse and one forward.
        If there is a resolver problem with some address, it becomes only
        that client's problem.  A hypothetical alternative
        implementation that only did forward lookups would have to
        resolve every host name mentioned in
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT
> during every connection attempt.
        That could be quite slow if many names are listed.
        And if there is a resolver problem with one of the host names,
        it becomes everyone's problem.
       </P
