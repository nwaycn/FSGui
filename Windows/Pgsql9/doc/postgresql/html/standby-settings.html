>        By default, a standby server restores WAL records from the
        primary as soon as possible. It may be useful to have a time-delayed
        copy of the data, offering opportunities to correct data loss errors.
        This parameter allows you to delay recovery by a fixed period of time,
        measured in milliseconds if no unit is specified.  For example, if
        you set this parameter to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5min</TT
>, the standby will
        replay each transaction commit only when the system time on the standby
        is at least five minutes past the commit time reported by the master.
       </P
><P
>        It is possible that the replication delay between servers exceeds the
        value of this parameter, in which case no delay is added.
        Note that the delay is calculated between the WAL time stamp as written
        on master and the current time on the standby. Delays in transfer
        because of network lag or cascading replication configurations
        may reduce the actual wait time significantly. If the system
        clocks on master and standby are not synchronized, this may lead to
        recovery applying records earlier than expected; but that is not a
        major issue because useful settings of this parameter are much larger
        than typical time deviations between servers.
       </P
><P
>        The delay occurs only on WAL records for transaction commits.
        Other records are replayed as quickly as possible, which
        is not a problem because MVCC visibility rules ensure their effects
        are not visible until the corresponding commit record is applied.
       </P
><P
>        The delay occurs once the database in recovery has reached a consistent
        state, until the standby is promoted or triggered. After that the standby
        will end recovery without further waiting.
       </P
><P
>        This parameter is intended for use with streaming replication deployments;
        however, if the parameter is specified it will be honored in all cases.
        Synchronous replication is not affected by this setting because there is
        not yet any setting to request synchronous apply of transaction commits.
        <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>hot_standby_feedback</TT
> will be delayed by use of this feature
        which could lead to bloat on the master; use both together with care.
