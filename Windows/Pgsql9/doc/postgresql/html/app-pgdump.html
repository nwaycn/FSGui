>   Description
  </H2
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> is a utility for backing up a
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> database. It makes consistent
   backups even if the database is being used concurrently.
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> does not block other users
   accessing the database (readers or writers).
  </P
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> only dumps a single database.  To backup
   global objects that are common to all databases in a cluster, such as roles
   and tablespaces, use <A
HREF="app-pg-dumpall.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dumpall</SPAN
></A
>.
  </P
><P
>   Dumps can be output in script or archive file formats. Script
   dumps are plain-text files containing the SQL commands required
   to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was
   saved. To restore from such a script, feed it to <A
HREF="app-psql.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
></A
>. Script files
   can be used to reconstruct the database even on other machines and
   other architectures; with some modifications, even on other SQL
   database products.
  </P
><P
>   The alternative archive file formats must be used with
   <A
HREF="app-pgrestore.html"
>pg_restore</A
> to rebuild the database.  They
   allow <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_restore</SPAN
> to be selective about
   what is restored, or even to reorder the items prior to being
   restored.
   The archive file formats are designed to be portable across
   architectures.
  </P
><P
>   When used with one of the archive file formats and combined with
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_restore</SPAN
>,
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> provides a flexible archival and
   transfer mechanism. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> can be used to
   backup an entire database, then <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_restore</SPAN
>
   can be used to examine the archive and/or select which parts of the
   database are to be restored. The most flexible output file formats are
   the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"custom"</SPAN
> format (<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-Fc</TT
>) and the
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"directory"</SPAN
> format(<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-Fd</TT
>). They allow
   for selection and reordering of all archived items, support parallel
   restoration, and are compressed by default. The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"directory"</SPAN
>
   format is the only format that supports parallel dumps.
  </P
><P
>   While running <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
>, one should examine the
   output for any warnings (printed on standard error), especially in
   light of the limitations listed below.

           However, the tar format does not support compression. Also, when

><P
>        Requesting exclusive locks on database objects while running a parallel dump could
        cause the dump to fail. The reason is that the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> master process
        requests shared locks on the objects that the worker processes are going to dump later
        in order to
        make sure that nobody deletes them and makes them go away while the dump is running.
        If another client then requests an exclusive lock on a table, that lock will not be
        granted but will be queued waiting for the shared lock of the master process to be
        released. Consequently any other access to the table will not be granted either and
        will queue after the exclusive lock request. This includes the worker process trying
        to dump the table. Without any precautions this would be a classic deadlock situation.
        To detect this conflict, the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> worker process requests another
        shared lock using the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NOWAIT</TT
> option. If the worker process is not granted
        this shared lock, somebody else must have requested an exclusive lock in the meantime
        and there is no way to continue with the dump, so <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> has no choice
        but to abort the dump.
       </P
><P
>        For a consistent backup, the database server needs to support synchronized snapshots,
        a feature that was introduced in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 9.2. With this
        feature, database clients can ensure they see the same data set even though they use
        different connections. <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pg_dump -j</TT
> uses multiple database
        connections; it connects to the database once with the master process and
        once again for each worker job. Without the synchronized snapshot feature, the
        different worker jobs wouldn't be guaranteed to see the same data in each connection,
        which could lead to an inconsistent backup.
       </P
><P
>        If you want to run a parallel dump of a pre-9.2 server, you need to make sure that the
        database content doesn't change from between the time the master connects to the
        database until the last worker job has connected to the database. The easiest way to
        do this is to halt any data modifying processes (DDL and DML) accessing the database
        before starting the backup. You also need to specify the
        <TT
CLASS="OPTION"

   (Currently, servers back to version 7.0 are supported.)
   However, <SPAN

   <SPAN

   it will refuse to even try, rather than risk making an invalid dump.
   Also, it is not guaranteed that <SPAN

   be loaded into a server of an older major version &mdash; not even if the
   dump was taken from a server of that version.  Loading a dump file

   to remove syntax not understood by the older server.
   Use of the <TT
