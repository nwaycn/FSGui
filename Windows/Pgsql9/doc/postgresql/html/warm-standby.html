   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"

  </P
><P
>   The primary and standby server work together to provide this capability,
   though the servers are only loosely coupled. The primary server operates
   in continuous archiving mode, while each standby server operates in
   continuous recovery mode, reading the WAL files from the primary. No
   changes to the database tables are required to enable this capability,
   so it offers low administration overhead compared to some other
   replication solutions. This configuration also has relatively low
   performance impact on the primary server.
  </P
><P
>   Directly moving WAL records from one database server to another
   is typically described as log shipping. <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
   implements file-based log shipping by transferring WAL records
   one file (WAL segment) at a time. WAL files (16MB) can be
   shipped easily and cheaply over any distance, whether it be to an
   adjacent system, another system at the same site, or another system on
   the far side of the globe. The bandwidth required for this technique
   varies according to the transaction rate of the primary server.
   Record-based log shipping is more granular and streams WAL changes
   incrementally over a network connection (see <A
HREF="warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION"
>Section 25.2.5</A
>).
  </P
><P
>   It should be noted that log shipping is asynchronous, i.e., the WAL
   records are shipped after transaction commit. As a result, there is a
   window for data loss should the primary server suffer a catastrophic
   failure; transactions not yet shipped will be lost.  The size of the
   data loss window in file-based log shipping can be limited by use of the
   <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_timeout</TT
> parameter, which can be set as low
   as a few seconds.  However such a low setting will
   substantially increase the bandwidth required for file shipping.
   Streaming replication (see <A
HREF="warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION"
>Section 25.2.5</A
>)
   allows a much smaller window of data loss.
  </P
><P
>   Recovery performance is sufficiently good that the standby will
   typically be only moments away from full
   availability once it has been activated. As a result, this is called
   a warm standby configuration which offers high
   availability. Restoring a server from an archived base backup and
   rollforward will take considerably longer, so that technique only
   offers a solution for disaster recovery, not high availability.
   A standby server can also be used for read-only queries, in which case
   it is called a Hot Standby server. See <A
HREF="hot-standby.html"
>Section 25.5</A

   more information.

>    It is usually wise to create the primary and standby servers
    so that they are as similar as possible, at least from the
    perspective of the database server.  In particular, the path names
    associated with tablespaces will be passed across unmodified, so both
    primary and standby servers must have the same mount paths for
    tablespaces if that feature is used.  Keep in mind that if
    <A
HREF="sql-createtablespace.html"
>CREATE TABLESPACE</A
>
    is executed on the primary, any new mount point needed for it must
    be created on the primary and all standby servers before the command
    is executed. Hardware need not be exactly the same, but experience shows
    that maintaining two identical systems is easier than maintaining two
    dissimilar ones over the lifetime of the application and system.
    In any case the hardware architecture must be the same &mdash; shipping
    from, say, a 32-bit to a 64-bit system will not work.
   </P
><P
>    In general, log shipping between servers running different major
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> release
    levels is not possible. It is the policy of the PostgreSQL Global
    Development Group not to make changes to disk formats during minor release
    upgrades, so it is likely that running different minor release levels
    on primary and standby servers will work successfully. However, no
    formal support for that is offered and you are advised to keep primary
    and standby servers at the same release level as much as possible.
    When updating to a new minor release, the safest policy is to update
    the standby servers first &mdash; a new minor release is more likely
    to be able to read WAL files from a previous minor release than vice
    versa.

    (see <A
HREF="archive-recovery-settings.html#RESTORE-COMMAND"
>restore_command</A

    over a TCP connection (streaming replication). The standby server will
    also attempt to restore any WAL found in the standby cluster's
    <TT

    restart, when the standby replays again WAL that was streamed from the

CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT

    fails, it tries to restore any WAL available in the <TT

    If that fails, and streaming replication has been configured, the
    standby tries to connect to the primary server and start streaming WAL
    from the last valid record found in archive or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog</TT
>. If that fails
    or streaming replication is not configured, or if the connection is
    later disconnected, the standby goes back to step 1 and tries to
    restore the file from the archive again. This loop of retries from the
    archive, <TT

    is stopped or failover is triggered by a trigger file.
