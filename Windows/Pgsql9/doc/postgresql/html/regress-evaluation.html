><P
>     If you run the tests against a server that was
     initialized with a collation-order locale other than C, then
     there might be differences due to sort order and subsequent
     failures.  The regression test suite is set up to handle this
     problem by providing alternate result files that together are
     known to handle a large number of locales.
    </P
><P
>     To run the tests in a different locale when using the
     temporary-installation method, pass the appropriate
     locale-related environment variables on
     the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</TT
> command line, for example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>make check LANG=de_DE.utf8</PRE
><P>
     (The regression test driver unsets <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LC_ALL</TT
>, so it
     does not work to choose the locale using that variable.)  To use
     no locale, either unset all locale-related environment variables
     (or set them to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C</TT
>) or use the following
     special invocation:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>make check NO_LOCALE=1</PRE
><P>
     When running the tests against an existing installation, the
     locale setup is determined by the existing installation.  To
     change it, initialize the database cluster with a different
     locale by passing the appropriate options
     to <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>     In general, it is advisable to try to run the
     regression tests in the locale setup that is wanted for
     production use, as this will exercise the locale- and
     encoding-related code portions that will actually be used in
     production.  Depending on the operating system environment, you
     might get failures, but then you will at least know what
     locale-specific behaviors to expect when running real
     applications.

></H2
><P
>You might see differences in which the same rows are output in a
different order than what appears in the expected file.  In most cases
this is not, strictly speaking, a bug.  Most of the regression test
scripts are not so pedantic as to use an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> for every single
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT</TT
>, and so their result row orderings are not well-defined
according to the SQL specification.  In practice, since we are
looking at the same queries being executed on the same data by the same
software, we usually get the same result ordering on all platforms,
so the lack of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> is not a problem.  Some queries do exhibit
cross-platform ordering differences, however.  When testing against an
already-installed server, ordering differences can also be caused by
non-C locale settings or non-default parameter settings, such as custom values
of <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>work_mem</TT
> or the planner cost parameters.
    </P
><P
>Therefore, if you see an ordering difference, it's not something to
worry about, unless the query does have an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> that your
result is violating.  However, please report it anyway, so that we can add an
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> to that particular query to eliminate the bogus
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"failure"</SPAN
> in future releases.
    </P
><P
>You might wonder why we don't order all the regression test queries explicitly
to get rid of this issue once and for all.  The reason is that that would
make the regression tests less useful, not more, since they'd tend
to exercise query plan types that produce ordered results to the
exclusion of those that don't.

     at the <TT

     the platform's limit on process stack size is smaller than the
     <A
HREF="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-STACK-DEPTH"
>max_stack_depth</A

     can be fixed by running the server under a higher stack
     size limit (4MB is recommended with the default value of
     <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_stack_depth</TT

     alternative is to reduce the value of <TT

    </P

     automatically choose a safe value of <TT
