   </P

    the view owner.  In some cases, this can be used to provide secure but
    restricted access to the underlying tables.  However, not all views are
    secure against tampering; see <A
HREF="rules-privileges.html"
>Section 38.5</A

    details.  Functions called in the view are treated the same as if they had
    been called directly from the query using the view.  Therefore the user of
    a view must have permissions to call all functions used by the view.
   </P

    existing view, only the view's defining SELECT rule is changed.
