><P
>    A useful extension to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> typically includes
    multiple SQL objects; for example, a new data type will require new
    functions, new operators, and probably new index operator classes.
    It is helpful to collect all these objects into a single package
    to simplify database management.  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> calls
    such a package an <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>extension</I
>.  To define an extension,
    you need at least a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>script file</I
> that contains the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> commands to create the extension's objects, and a
    <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>control file</I
> that specifies a few basic properties
    of the extension itself.  If the extension includes C code, there
    will typically also be a shared library file into which the C code
    has been built.  Once you have these files, a simple
    <A
HREF="sql-createextension.html"
>CREATE EXTENSION</A
> command loads the objects into
    your database.
   </P
><P
>    The main advantage of using an extension, rather than just running the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> script to load a bunch of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loose"</SPAN
> objects
    into your database, is that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> will then
    understand that the objects of the extension go together.  You can
    drop all the objects with a single <A
HREF="sql-dropextension.html"
>DROP EXTENSION</A
>
    command (no need to maintain a separate <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"uninstall"</SPAN
> script).
    Even more useful, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> knows that it should not
    dump the individual member objects of the extension &mdash; it will
    just include a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE EXTENSION</TT
> command in dumps, instead.
    This vastly simplifies migration to a new version of the extension
    that might contain more or different objects than the old version.
    Note however that you must have the extension's control, script, and
    other files available when loading such a dump into a new database.
   </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> will not let you drop an individual object
    contained in an extension, except by dropping the whole extension.
    Also, while you can change the definition of an extension member object
    (for example, via <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION</TT
> for a
    function), bear in mind that the modified definition will not be dumped
    by <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
>.  Such a change is usually only sensible if
    you concurrently make the same change in the extension's script file.
    (But there are special provisions for tables containing configuration
    data; see below.)
   </P
><P
>    The extension mechanism also has provisions for packaging modification
    scripts that adjust the definitions of the SQL objects contained in an
    extension.  For example, if version 1.1 of an extension adds one function
    and changes the body of another function compared to 1.0, the extension
    author can provide an <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>update script</I
> that makes just those
    two changes.  The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE</TT
> command can then
    be used to apply these changes and track which version of the extension
    is actually installed in a given database.
   </P
><P
>    The kinds of SQL objects that can be members of an extension are shown in
    the description of <A
HREF="sql-alterextension.html"
>ALTER EXTENSION</A
>.  Notably, objects
    that are database-cluster-wide, such as databases, roles, and tablespaces,
    cannot be extension members since an extension is only known within one
    database.  (Although an extension script is not prohibited from creating
    such objects, if it does so they will not be tracked as part of the
    extension.)  Also notice that while a table can be a member of an
    extension, its subsidiary objects such as indexes are not directly
    considered members of the extension.
    Another important point is that schemas can belong to extensions, but not
    vice versa: an extension as such has an unqualified name and does not
    exist <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"within"</SPAN
> any schema.  The extension's member objects,
    however, will belong to schemas whenever appropriate for their object
    types.  It may or may not be appropriate for an extension to own the
    schema(s) its member objects are within.

><P
>     One advantage of the extension mechanism is that it provides convenient
     ways to manage updates to the SQL commands that define an extension's
     objects.  This is done by associating a version name or number with
     each released version of the extension's installation script.
     In addition, if you want users to be able to update their databases
     dynamically from one version to the next, you should provide
     <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>update scripts</I
> that make the necessary changes to go from
     one version to the next.  Update scripts have names following the pattern
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>extension</I
></TT
>--<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>oldversion</I
></TT
>--<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>newversion</I
></TT
>.sql</TT
>
     (for example, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo--1.0--1.1.sql</TT
> contains the commands to modify
     version <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1.0</TT
> of extension <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
> into version
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1.1</TT
>).
    </P
><P
>     Given that a suitable update script is available, the command
     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE</TT
> will update an installed extension
     to the specified new version.  The update script is run in the same
     environment that <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE EXTENSION</TT
> provides for installation
     scripts: in particular, <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>search_path</TT
> is set up in the same
     way, and any new objects created by the script are automatically added
     to the extension.
    </P
><P
>     If an extension has secondary control files, the control parameters
     that are used for an update script are those associated with the script's
     target (new) version.
    </P
><P
>     The update mechanism can be used to solve an important special case:
     converting a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loose"</SPAN
> collection of objects into an extension.
     Before the extension mechanism was added to
     <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> (in 9.1), many people wrote
     extension modules that simply created assorted unpackaged objects.
     Given an existing database containing such objects, how can we convert
     the objects into a properly packaged extension?  Dropping them and then
     doing a plain <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE EXTENSION</TT
> is one way, but it's not
     desirable if the objects have dependencies (for example, if there are
     table columns of a data type created by the extension).  The way to fix
     this situation is to create an empty extension, then use <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER
     EXTENSION ADD</TT
> to attach each pre-existing object to the extension,
     then finally create any new objects that are in the current extension
     version but were not in the unpackaged release.  <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE
     EXTENSION</TT
> supports this case with its <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
> <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>old_version</I
></TT
> option, which causes it to not run the
     normal installation script for the target version, but instead the update
     script named
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>extension</I
></TT
>--<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>old_version</I
></TT
>--<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>target_version</I
></TT
>.sql</TT
>.
     The choice of the dummy version name to use as <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>old_version</I
></TT
> is up to the extension author, though
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unpackaged</TT
> is a common convention.  If you have multiple
     prior versions you need to be able to update into extension style, use
     multiple dummy version names to identify them.
    </P
><P
>     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER EXTENSION</TT
> is able to execute sequences of update
     script files to achieve a requested update.  For example, if only
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo--1.0--1.1.sql</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo--1.1--2.0.sql</TT
> are
     available, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER EXTENSION</TT
> will apply them in sequence if an
     update to version <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2.0</TT
> is requested when <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1.0</TT
> is
     currently installed.
    </P
><P
>     <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> doesn't assume anything about the properties
     of version names: for example, it does not know whether <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1.1</TT
>
     follows <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1.0</TT
>.  It just matches up the available version names
     and follows the path that requires applying the fewest update scripts.
     (A version name can actually be any string that doesn't contain
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--</TT
> or leading or trailing <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-</TT
>.)
    </P
><P
>     Sometimes it is useful to provide <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"downgrade"</SPAN
> scripts, for
     example <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo--1.1--1.0.sql</TT
> to allow reverting the changes
     associated with version <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1.1</TT
>.  If you do that, be careful
     of the possibility that a downgrade script might unexpectedly
     get applied because it yields a shorter path.  The risky case is where
     there is a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"fast path"</SPAN
> update script that jumps ahead several
     versions as well as a downgrade script to the fast path's start point.
     It might take fewer steps to apply the downgrade and then the fast
     path than to move ahead one version at a time.  If the downgrade script
     drops any irreplaceable objects, this will yield undesirable results.
    </P
><P
>     To check for unexpected update paths, use this command:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM pg_extension_update_paths('<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>extension_name</I
></TT
>');</PRE
><P>
     This shows each pair of distinct known version names for the specified
     extension, together with the update path sequence that would be taken to
     get from the source version to the target version, or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
> if
     there is no available update path.  The path is shown in textual form
     with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--</TT
> separators.  You can use
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>regexp_split_to_array(path,'--')</TT
> if you prefer an array
     format.
