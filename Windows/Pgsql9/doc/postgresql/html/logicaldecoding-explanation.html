>     Logical decoding is the process of extracting all persistent changes
     to a database's tables into a coherent, easy to understand format which
     can be interpreted without detailed knowledge of the database's internal
     state.
    </P

>     In <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

>, logical decoding is implemented
     by decoding the contents of the <A

     log</A
>, which describe changes on a storage level, into an
     application-specific form such as a stream of tuples or SQL statements.

></H2
><P
>     In the context of logical replication, a slot represents a stream of
     changes that can be replayed to a client in the order they were made on
     the origin server. Each slot streams a sequence of changes from a single
     database, sending each change exactly once (except when peeking forward
     in the stream).

     differently there.

>     A replication slot has an identifier that is unique across all databases
     in a <SPAN

> cluster. Slots persist
     independently of the connection using them and are crash-safe.
    </P
><P
>     Multiple independent slots may exist for a single database. Each slot has
     its own state, allowing different consumers to receive changes from
     different points in the database change stream. For most applications, a
     separate slot will be required for each consumer.
    </P
><P
>     A logical replication slot knows nothing about the state of the
     receiver(s).  It's even possible to have multiple different receivers using
     the same slot at different times; they'll just get the changes following
     on from when the last receiver stopped consuming them. Only one receiver
     may consume changes from a slot at any given time.

      slot.  So if a slot is no longer required it should be dropped.

     a snapshot is exported
     (see <A
HREF="functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-SNAPSHOT-SYNCHRONIZATION"

     exactly the state of the database after which all changes will be

     database's state at that point in time, which afterwards can be updated
     using the slot's contents without losing any changes.
