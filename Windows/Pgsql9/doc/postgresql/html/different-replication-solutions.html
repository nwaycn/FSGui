>     Shared disk failover avoids synchronization overhead by having only one
     copy of the database.  It uses a single disk array that is shared by
     multiple servers.  If the main database server fails, the standby server
     is able to mount and start the database as though it were recovering from
     a database crash.  This allows rapid failover with no data loss.

     Using a network file system is also possible, though care must be

CLASS="ACRONYM"
>POSIX</ACRONYM
> behavior (see <A
HREF="creating-cluster.html#CREATING-CLUSTER-NFS"
>Section 17.2.2</A
>).  One significant limitation of this
     method is that if the shared disk array fails or becomes corrupt, the
     primary and standby servers are both nonfunctional.  Another issue is
     that the standby server should never access the shared storage while
     the primary server is running.

     has a consistent copy of the file system &mdash; specifically, writes

>Statement-Based Replication Middleware</DT
><DD
><P
>     With statement-based replication middleware, a program intercepts
     every SQL query and sends it to one or all servers.  Each server
     operates independently.  Read-write queries must be sent to all servers,
     so that every server receives any changes.  But read-only queries can be
     sent to just one server, allowing the read workload to be distributed
     among them.
    </P
><P
>     If queries are simply broadcast unmodified, functions like
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>random()</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</CODE
>, and
     sequences can have different values on different servers.
     This is because each server operates independently, and because
     SQL queries are broadcast (and not actual modified rows).  If
     this is unacceptable, either the middleware or the application
     must query such values from a single server and then use those
     values in write queries.  Another option is to use this replication
     option with a traditional master-standby setup, i.e. data modification
     queries are sent only to the master and are propagated to the
     standby servers via master-standby replication, not by the replication
     middleware.  Care must also be taken that all
     transactions either commit or abort on all servers, perhaps
     using two-phase commit (<A
HREF="sql-prepare-transaction.html"
>PREPARE TRANSACTION</A
>
     and <A
HREF="sql-commit-prepared.html"
>COMMIT PREPARED</A
>.
     <SPAN

     are examples of this type of replication.

>Asynchronous Multimaster Replication</DT
><DD
><P
>     For servers that are not regularly connected, like laptops or
     remote servers, keeping data consistent among servers is a
     challenge.  Using asynchronous multimaster replication, each
     server works independently, and periodically communicates with
     the other servers to identify conflicting transactions.  The
     conflicts can be resolved by users or conflict resolution rules.
     Bucardo is an example of this type of replication.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>Synchronous Multimaster Replication</DT
><DD
><P
>     In synchronous multimaster replication, each server can accept
     write requests, and modified data is transmitted from the
     original server to every other server before each transaction
     commits.  Heavy write activity can cause excessive locking,
     leading to poor performance.  In fact, write performance is
     often worse than that of a single server.  Read requests can
     be sent to any server.  Some implementations use shared disk
     to reduce the communication overhead.  Synchronous multimaster
     replication is best for mostly read workloads, though its big
     advantage is that any server can accept write requests &mdash;
     there is no need to partition workloads between master and
     standby servers, and because the data changes are sent from one
     server to another, there is no problem with non-deterministic
     functions like <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>random()</CODE
>.

>     Data partitioning splits tables into data sets.  Each set can
     be modified by only one server.  For example, data can be
     partitioned by offices, e.g., London and Paris, with a server
     in each office.  If queries combining London and Paris data
     are necessary, an application can query both servers, or
     master/standby replication can be used to keep a read-only copy
     of the other office's data on each server.

>Multiple-Server Parallel Query Execution</DT

>     Many of the above solutions allow multiple servers to handle multiple

     complete faster.  This solution allows multiple servers to work
     concurrently on a single query.  It is usually accomplished by
     splitting the data among servers and having each server execute its
     part of the query and return results to a central server where they
     are combined and returned to the user.  <SPAN
