>    It is very difficult to enforce business rules regarding data integrity
    using Read Committed transactions because the view of the data is
    shifting with each statement, and even a single statement may not
    restrict itself to the statement's snapshot if a write conflict occurs.
   </P
><P
>    While a Repeatable Read transaction has a stable view of the data
    throughout its execution, there is a subtle issue with using
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MVCC</ACRONYM
> snapshots for data consistency checks, involving
    something known as <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>read/write conflicts</I
>.
    If one transaction writes data and a concurrent transaction attempts
    to read the same data (whether before or after the write), it cannot
    see the work of the other transaction.  The reader then appears to have
    executed first regardless of which started first or which committed
    first.  If that is as far as it goes, there is no problem, but
    if the reader also writes data which is read by a concurrent transaction
    there is now a transaction which appears to have run before either of
    the previously mentioned transactions.  If the transaction which appears
    to have executed last actually commits first, it is very easy for a
    cycle to appear in a graph of the order of execution of the transactions.
    When such a cycle appears, integrity checks will not work correctly
    without some help.

>    As mentioned in <A
HREF="transaction-iso.html#XACT-SERIALIZABLE"
>Section 13.2.3</A
>, Serializable
    transactions are just Repeatable Read transactions which add
    nonblocking monitoring for dangerous patterns of read/write conflicts.
    When a pattern is detected which could cause a cycle in the apparent
    order of execution, one of the transactions involved is rolled back to
    break the cycle.

     <TT

     It would also be wise to take some action to ensure that no other

     subvert integrity checks, through checks of the transaction isolation

     For example, a banking application might wish to check that the sum of
     all credits in one table equals the sum of debits in another table,
     when both tables are being actively updated.  Comparing the results of two
     successive <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT sum(...)</TT
> commands will not work reliably in
     Read Committed mode, since the second query will likely include the results
     of transactions not counted by the first.  Doing the two sums in a
     single repeatable read transaction will give an accurate picture of only the
     effects of transactions that committed before the repeatable read transaction
     started &mdash; but one might legitimately wonder whether the answer is still
     relevant by the time it is delivered.  If the repeatable read transaction
     itself applied some changes before trying to make the consistency check,
     the usefulness of the check becomes even more debatable, since now it
     includes some but not all post-transaction-start changes.  In such cases
     a careful person might wish to lock all tables needed for the check,
     in order to get an indisputable picture of current reality.  A
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</TT
> mode (or higher) lock guarantees that there are no
     uncommitted changes in the locked table, other than those of the current
     transaction.
    </P
><P
>     Note also that if one is relying on explicit locking to prevent concurrent
     changes, one should either use Read Committed mode, or in Repeatable Read
     mode be careful to obtain
     locks before performing queries.  A lock obtained by a
     repeatable read transaction guarantees that no other transactions modifying
     the table are still running, but if the snapshot seen by the
     transaction predates obtaining the lock, it might predate some now-committed
     changes in the table.  A repeatable read transaction's snapshot is actually
     frozen at the start of its first query or data-modification command
     (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT</TT
>,
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPDATE</TT
>, or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>DELETE</TT
>), so
     it is possible to obtain locks explicitly before the snapshot is
     frozen.
