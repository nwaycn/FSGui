     </P
><P
>      This change reduces the amount of indentation applied to nested
      constructs, including some cases that the user probably doesn't think
      of as nested, such as UNION lists.  Previously, deeply nested
      constructs were printed with an amount of whitespace growing as
      O(N^2), which created a performance problem and even risk of
      out-of-memory failures.  Now the indentation is reduced modulo 40,
      which is initially odd to look at but seems to preserve readability
      better than simply limiting the indentation would do.
      Redundant parenthesization of UNION lists has been reduced as well.

      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory
      of <TT

      Unix sockets are not supported, notably Windows, because then the
