        (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient

        traffic (or has slack periods where it does so), there could be a
        long delay between the completion of a transaction and its safe
        recording in archive storage.  To limit how old unarchived

        segment file whenever this many seconds have elapsed since the last

        including a single checkpoint.  (Increasing
        <TT

        Note that archived files that are closed early
