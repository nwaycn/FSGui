   specifies how to perform a conversion between
   two data types.  For example,
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT CAST(42 AS float8);</PRE

   converts the integer constant 42 to type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

>   Two types can be <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>binary coercible</I
>, which
   means that the conversion can be performed <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"for free"</SPAN
>
   without invoking any function.  This requires that corresponding
   values use the same internal representation.  For instance, the
   types <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>varchar</TT
> are binary
   coercible both ways.  Binary coercibility is not necessarily a
   symmetric relationship.  For example, the cast
   from <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>xml</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> can be performed for
   free in the present implementation, but the reverse direction
   requires a function that performs at least a syntax check.  (Two
   types that are binary coercible both ways are also referred to as
   binary compatible.)
  </P
><P
>   You can define a cast as an <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>I/O conversion cast</I
> by using
   the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH INOUT</TT
> syntax. An I/O conversion cast is
   performed by invoking the output function of the source data type, and
   passing the resulting string to the input function of the target data type.
   In many common cases, this feature avoids the need to write a separate
   cast function for conversion. An I/O conversion cast acts the same as
   a regular function-based cast; only the implementation is different.
  </P
><P

  </P
><P
>   If the cast is marked <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   implicitly when assigning a value to a column of the target data type.
   For example, supposing that <TT

   type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

><P>
   will be allowed if the cast from type <TT

   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

CLASS="LITERAL"

   (We generally use the term <I

   cast</I

  </P
><P

   implicitly in any context, whether assignment or internally in an
   expression.  (We generally use the term <I

>implicit
   cast</I
> to describe this kind of cast.)
   For example, consider this query:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT 2 + 4.0;</PRE
><P>
   The parser initially marks the constants as being of type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
>
   and <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT

CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
>
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>+</TT
> <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

   but there is a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>+</TT
> <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT
> operator.
   The query will therefore succeed if a cast from <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
> to
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT
> is available and is marked <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>AS IMPLICIT</TT
> &mdash;
   which in fact it is.  The parser will apply the implicit cast and resolve
   the query as if it had been written
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT CAST ( 2 AS numeric ) + 4.0;</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   Now, the catalogs also provide a cast from <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT
> to
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
>.  If that cast were marked <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>AS IMPLICIT</TT
> &mdash;
   which it is not &mdash; then the parser would be faced with choosing
   between the above interpretation and the alternative of casting the
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT
> constant to <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
> and applying the
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>+</TT
> <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
> operator.  Lacking any
   knowledge of which choice to prefer, it would give up and declare the
   query ambiguous.  The fact that only one of the two casts is
   implicit is the way in which we teach the parser to prefer resolution
   of a mixed <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT
>-and-<TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
> expression as
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>numeric</TT
>; there is no built-in knowledge about that.
  </P
><P

   overabundance of implicit casting paths can cause
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

   interpretations of commands, or to be unable to resolve commands at
   all because there are multiple possible interpretations.  A good
   rule of thumb is to make a cast implicitly invokable only for
   information-preserving transformations between types in the same
   general type category.  For example, the cast from <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>int2</TT
> to
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>int4</TT
> can reasonably be implicit, but the cast from
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

CLASS="TYPE"
>int4</TT

   assignment-only.  Cross-type-category casts, such as <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT

   to <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>int4</TT

   However, it is allowed to declare a cast with identical source and
   target types if it has a cast implementation function with more than one
   argument.  This is used to represent type-specific length coercion
   functions in the system catalogs.  The named function is used to
   coerce a value of the type to the type modifier value given by its
   second argument.
  </P
><P
>   When a cast has different source and
   target types and a function that takes more than one argument, it
   supports converting from one type to another and applying a length
   coercion in a single step.  When no such entry is available, coercion
   to a type that uses a type modifier involves two cast steps, one to
   convert between data types and a second to apply the modifier.

   provides automatic I/O conversion casts for that. The automatic casts to
   string types are treated as assignment casts, while the automatic casts
   from string types are
   explicit-only.  You can override this behavior by declaring your own
   cast to replace an automatic cast, but usually the only reason to
   do so is if you want the conversion to be more easily invokable than the
   standard assignment-only or explicit-only setting.  Another possible
   reason is that you want the conversion to behave differently from the
   type's I/O function; but that is sufficiently surprising that you
   should think twice about whether it's a good idea.  (A small number of
   the built-in types do indeed have different behaviors for conversions,
   mostly because of requirements of the SQL standard.)
  </P
><P
>   While not required, it is recommended that you continue to follow this old
   convention of naming cast implementation functions after the target data
   type.  Many users are used to being able to cast data types using a
   function-style notation, that is
   <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>typename</I
></TT
>(<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>x</I
></TT
>).  This notation is in fact
   nothing more nor less than a call of the cast implementation function; it
   is not specially treated as a cast.  If your conversion functions are not
   named to support this convention then you will have surprised users.
   Since <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> allows overloading of the same function
   name with different argument types, there is no difficulty in having
   multiple conversion functions from different types that all use the
   target type's name.
