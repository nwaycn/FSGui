><DT
>Improve concurrent access to the shared buffer cache (Tom)</DT
><DD
><P
>       Access to the shared buffer cache was identified as a
       significant scalability problem, particularly on multi-CPU
       systems. In this release, the way that locking is done in the
       buffer manager has been overhauled to reduce lock contention
       and improve scalability. The buffer manager has also been
       changed to use a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"clock sweep"</SPAN
> replacement
       policy.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>Allow index scans to use an intermediate in-memory bitmap (Tom)</DT
><DD
><P
>       In previous releases, only a single index could be used to do
       lookups on a table. With this feature, if a query has
       <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>WHERE tab.col1 = 4 and tab.col2 = 9</TT
>, and there is
       no multicolumn index on <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col2</TT
>,
       but there is an index on <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col1</TT
> and another on
       <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col2</TT
>, it is possible to search both indexes and
       combine the results in memory, then do heap fetches for only
       the rows matching both the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col1</TT
> and
       <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col2</TT
> restrictions. This is very useful in
       environments that have a lot of unstructured queries where it
       is impossible to create indexes that match all possible access
       conditions.  Bitmap scans are useful even with a single index,
       as they reduce the amount of random access needed; a bitmap
       index scan is efficient for retrieving fairly large fractions
       of the complete table, whereas plain index scans are not.
      </P

><DT
>Add two-phase commit (Heikki Linnakangas, Alvaro, Tom)</DT
><DD
><P
>       Two-phase commit allows transactions to be "prepared" on several
       computers, and once all computers have successfully prepared
       their transactions (none failed), all transactions can be
       committed. Even if a machine crashes after a prepare, the
       prepared transaction can be committed after the machine is
       restarted. New syntax includes <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>PREPARE TRANSACTION</TT
> and
       <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COMMIT/ROLLBACK PREPARED</TT
>. A new system view
       <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_prepared_xacts</TT

><DT
>Create a new role system that replaces users and groups
      (Stephen Frost)</DT
><DD
><P
>       Roles are a combination of users and groups. Like users, they
       can have login capability, and like groups, a role can have
       other roles as members. Roles basically remove the distinction
       between users and groups. For example, a role can:
      </P
><P

><P
>         Inherit permissions from other roles it is a member of
        </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>       Once a user logs into a role, she obtains capabilities of
       the login role plus any inherited roles, and can use
       <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SET ROLE</TT
> to switch to other roles she is a member of.
       This feature is a generalization of the SQL standard's concept of
       roles.
       This change also replaces <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_shadow</TT

       <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"

       <TT

       tables are redefined as read-only views on the new role tables.

     </P
><P
>      Currently <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

      backslash in a string literal as introducing a special escape sequence,
      e.g. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\n</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\010</TT
>.
      While this allows easy entry of special values, it is
      nonstandard and makes porting of applications from other
      databases more difficult. For this reason, the
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> project is planning to
      remove the special meaning of backslashes in strings. For
      backward compatibility and for users who want special backslash
      processing, a new string syntax has been created. This new string
      syntax is formed by writing an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E</TT
> immediately preceding the
      single quote that starts the string, e.g. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E'hi\n'</TT
>. While
      this release does not change the handling of backslashes in strings, it
      does add new configuration parameters to help users migrate applications
      for future releases:
     </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>        <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"

></LI
><LI
><P
>       <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>escape_string_warning</TT

       ordinary (non-E) strings
      </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>      The <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>standard_conforming_strings</TT
> value is read-only.
      Applications can retrieve the value to know how backslashes are
      processed.  (Presence of the parameter can also be taken as an
      indication that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
> string syntax is supported.)
      In a future release, <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>standard_conforming_strings</TT
>
      will be true, meaning backslashes will be treated literally in
      non-E strings. To prepare for this change, use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
>
      strings in places that need special backslash processing, and
      turn on <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>escape_string_warning</TT
> to find additional
      strings that need to be converted to use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
>.
      Also, use two single-quotes (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>''</TT
>) to embed a literal
      single-quote in a string, rather than the
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>-supported syntax of
      backslash single-quote (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\'</TT
>).  The former is
      standards-conforming and does not require the use of the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
> string syntax.  You can also use the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$$</TT
> string syntax, which does not treat backslashes
      specially.
