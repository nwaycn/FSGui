>   This module integrates with <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SELinux</SPAN
> to provide an
   additional layer of security checking above and beyond what is normally
   provided by <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>.  From the perspective of
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SELinux</SPAN
>, this module allows
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> to function as a user-space object
   manager.  Each table or function access initiated by a DML query will be
   checked against the system security policy.  This check is in addition to
   the usual SQL permissions checking performed by
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>.
  </P
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SELinux</SPAN
> access control decisions are made using
   security labels, which are represented by strings such as
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>system_u:object_r:sepgsql_table_t:s0</TT
>.  Each access control
   decision involves two labels: the label of the subject attempting to
   perform the action, and the label of the object on which the operation is
   to be performed.  Since these labels can be applied to any sort of object,
   access control decisions for objects stored within the database can be
   (and, with this module, are) subjected to the same general criteria used
   for objects of any other type, such as files.  This design is intended to
   allow a centralized security policy to protect information assets
   independent of the particulars of how those assets are stored.

><P
>   Due to the nature of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SELinux</SPAN
>, running the
   regression tests for <TT

   configuration steps, some of which must be done as root.
   The regression tests will not be run by an ordinary
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make check</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make installcheck</TT
> command; you must
   set up the configuration and then invoke the test script manually.
   The tests must be run in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib/sepgsql</TT
> directory
   of a configured PostgreSQL build tree.  Although they require a build tree,
   the tests are designed to be executed against an installed server,
   that is they are comparable to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make installcheck</TT
> not
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

  </P

CLASS="FILENAME"
>sepgsql</TT
> in a working database
   according to the instructions in <A
HREF="sepgsql.html#SEPGSQL-INSTALLATION"

   Note that the current operating system user must be able to connect to the
   database as superuser without password authentication.
  </P
><P
>   Second, build and install the policy package for the regression test.
   The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sepgsql-regtest</TT
> policy is a special purpose policy package
   which provides a set of rules to be allowed during the regression tests.
   It should be built from the policy source file
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sepgsql-regtest.te</TT
>, which is done using
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</TT
> with a Makefile supplied by SELinux.
   You will need to locate the appropriate
   Makefile on your system; the path shown below is only an example.
   Once built, install this policy package using the
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>semodule</TT
> command, which loads supplied policy packages
   into the kernel.  If the package is correctly installed,
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>semodule</TT
> -l</TT
> should list <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sepgsql-regtest</TT

   available policy package:
  </P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

CLASS="LITERAL"
>sepgsql_regression_test_mode</TT

   For security reasons, the rules in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sepgsql-regtest</TT

   are not enabled by default;
   the <TT

    control rules as relationships between a subject entity (typically,
    a client of the database) and an object entity (such as a database
    object), each of which is
    identified by a security label.  If access to an unlabeled object is

    <TT

   </P

    When <TT

>sepgsql</TT
> is in use, security labels are
    automatically assigned to supported database objects at creation time.
    This label is called a default security label, and is decided according
    to the system security policy, which takes as input the creator's label,
    the label assigned to the new object's parent object and optionally name
    of the constructed object.
   </P

    object, except when the security policy has special rules known as

    sequences, views, and functions, it is the containing schema; for columns,

><P
>    It is possible to use SELinux's dynamic domain transition feature
    to switch the security label of the client process, the client domain,
    to a new context, if that is allowed by the security policy.
    The client domain needs the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>setcurrent</TT
> permission and also
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>dyntransition</TT
> from the old to the new domain.
   </P

>    Dynamic domain transitions should be considered carefully, because they
    allow users to switch their label, and therefore their privileges,
    at their option, rather than (as in the case of a trusted procedure)
    as mandated by the system.
    Thus, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>dyntransition</TT
> permission is only considered
    safe when used to switch to a domain with a smaller set of privileges than
    the original one. For example:
   </P

    switching back was denied.
   </P
><P
>    A combination of dynamic domain transition and trusted procedure
    enables an interesting use case that fits the typical process life-cycle
    of connection pooling software.
    Even if your connection pooling software is not allowed to run most
    of SQL commands, you can allow it to switch the security label
    of the client using the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sepgsql_setcon()</TT
> function
    from within a trusted procedure; that should take some
    credential to authorize the request to switch the client label.
    After that, this session will have the privileges of the target user,
    rather than the connection pooler.
    The connection pooler can later revert the security label change by
    again using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sepgsql_setcon()</TT
> with
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
> argument, again invoked from within a trusted
    procedure with appropriate permissions checks.
    The point here is that only the trusted procedure actually has permission
    to change the effective security label, and only does so when given proper
    credentials.  Of course, for secure operation, the credential store
    (table, procedure definition, or whatever) must be protected from
    unauthorized access.
