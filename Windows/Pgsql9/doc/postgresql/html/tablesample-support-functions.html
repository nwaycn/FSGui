   This function is called during planning.  It must estimate the number of
   relation pages that will be read during a sample scan, and the number of
   tuples that will be selected by the scan.  (For example, these might be
   determined by estimating the sampling fraction, and then multiplying
   the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baserel-&gt;pages</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>baserel-&gt;tuples</TT
>
   numbers by that, being sure to round the results to integral values.)
   The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>paramexprs</TT
> list holds the expression(s) that are
   parameters to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

> clause.  It is recommended to
   use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>estimate_expression_value()</CODE

   expressions to constants, if their values are needed for estimation
   purposes; but the function must provide size estimates even if they cannot
   be reduced, and it should not fail even if the values appear invalid

   Begin execution of a sampling scan.
   This is called just before the first attempt to fetch a tuple, and
   may be called again if the scan needs to be restarted.
   Information about the table to scan is accessible through fields
   of the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>SampleScanState</TT
> node (but note that the
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   values of the parameters supplied in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   These will have the number and types specified in the sampling
   method's <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>parameterTypes</TT
> list, and have been checked
   to not be null.
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>seed</TT

   If <TT

   If <TT

   default, the scan will perform visibility checking in a single pass for

   to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>false</TT

   tuples on each visited page.  That will result in fewer tuple visibility
   checks being performed, though each one will be more expensive because it

  </P

   Such a scan can use synchronized scanning, so that the sampling method
   cannot assume that the relation pages are visited in the same order on
   each scan.

   to release palloc'd memory, but any externally-visible resources
   should be cleaned up.
   This function can be omitted (set the pointer to NULL) in the common
