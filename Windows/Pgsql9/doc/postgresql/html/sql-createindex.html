   Indexes are primarily used to enhance database performance (though
   inappropriate use can result in slower performance).
  </P

>   The key field(s) for the index are specified as column names,
   or alternatively as expressions written in parentheses.
   Multiple fields can be specified if the index method supports
   multicolumn indexes.
  </P
><P
>   An index field can be an expression computed from the values of
   one or more columns of the table row.  This feature can be used
   to obtain fast access to data based on some transformation of
   the basic data. For example, an index computed on
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>upper(col)</TT
> would allow the clause
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE upper(col) = 'JIM'</TT
> to use an index.
  </P
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> provides the index methods
   B-tree, hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, and BRIN.  Users can also define their own
   index methods, but that is fairly complicated.
  </P
><P
>    When the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause is present, a
    <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>partial index</I
> is created.
    A partial index is an index that contains entries for only a portion of
    a table, usually a portion that is more useful for indexing than the
    rest of the table. For example, if you have a table that contains both
    billed and unbilled orders where the unbilled orders take up a small
    fraction of the total table and yet that is an often used section, you
    can improve performance by creating an index on just that portion.
    Another possible application is to use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> with
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNIQUE</TT
> to enforce uniqueness over a subset of a
    table.  See <A
HREF="indexes-partial.html"
>Section 11.8</A
> for more discussion.
  </P
><P
>    The expression used in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause can refer
    only to columns of the underlying table, but it can use all columns,
    not just the ones being indexed.  Presently, subqueries and
    aggregate expressions are also forbidden in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>.
    The same restrictions apply to index fields that are expressions.
  </P
><P
>   All functions and operators used in an index definition must be
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"immutable"</SPAN
>, that is, their results must depend only on
   their arguments and never on any outside influence (such as
   the contents of another table or the current time).  This restriction
   ensures that the behavior of the index is well-defined.  To use a
   user-defined function in an index expression or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>
   clause, remember to mark the function immutable when you create it.

      If the table is static then fillfactor 100 is best to minimize the

      fillfactor is better to minimize the need for page splits.  The

>    Creating an index can interfere with regular operation of a database.
    Normally <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> locks the table to be indexed against
    writes and performs the entire index build with a single scan of the
    table. Other transactions can still read the table, but if they try to
    insert, update, or delete rows in the table they will block until the
    index build is finished. This could have a severe effect if the system is
    a live production database.  Very large tables can take many hours to be
    indexed, and even for smaller tables, an index build can lock out writers
    for periods that are unacceptably long for a production system.
   </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    out writes.  This method is invoked by specifying the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

> option of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX</TT
>.
    When this option is used,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> must perform two scans of the table, and in
    addition it must wait for all existing transactions that could potentially
    modify or use the index to terminate.  Thus
    this method requires more total work than a standard index build and takes
    significantly longer to complete.  However, since it allows normal
    operations to continue while the index is built, this method is useful for
    adding new indexes in a production environment.  Of course, the extra CPU
    and I/O load imposed by the index creation might slow other operations.
   </P
><P
>    In a concurrent index build, the index is actually entered into
    the system catalogs in one transaction, then two table scans occur in
    two more transactions.  Before each table scan, the index build must
    wait for existing transactions that have modified the table to terminate.
    After the second scan, the index build must wait for any transactions
    that have a snapshot (see <A
HREF="mvcc.html"
>Chapter 13</A
>) predating the second
    scan to terminate.  Then finally the index can be marked ready for use,
    and the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX</TT
> command terminates.
    Even then, however, the index may not be immediately usable for queries:
    in the worst case, it cannot be used as long as transactions exist that
    predate the start of the index build.
   </P
><P

    The recommended recovery

   </P
><P
>    Another caveat when building a unique index concurrently is that the
    uniqueness constraint is already being enforced against other transactions
    when the second table scan begins.  This means that constraint violations
    could be reported in other queries prior to the index becoming available
    for use, or even in cases where the index build eventually fails.  Also,
    if a failure does occur in the second scan, the <SPAN

    continues to enforce its uniqueness constraint afterwards.

   (This limit can be altered when building
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>.)  Only B-tree currently
   supports unique indexes.
  </P
><P
>   An <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>operator class</I
> can be specified for each
   column of an index. The operator class identifies the operators to be
   used by the index for that column. For example, a B-tree index on
   four-byte integers would use the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>int4_ops</TT
> class;
   this operator class includes comparison functions for four-byte
   integers. In practice the default operator class for the column's data
   type is usually sufficient. The main point of having operator classes
   is that for some data types, there could be more than one meaningful
   ordering. For example, we might want to sort a complex-number data
   type either by absolute value or by real part. We could do this by
   defining two operator classes for the data type and then selecting
   the proper class when making an index.  More information about
   operator classes is in <A
HREF="indexes-opclass.html"
>Section 11.9</A
> and in <A
HREF="xindex.html"
>Section 35.14</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   For index methods that support ordered scans (currently, only B-tree),
   the optional clauses <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ASC</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>DESC</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULLS
   FIRST</TT
>, and/or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULLS LAST</TT
> can be specified to modify
   the sort ordering of the index.  Since an ordered index can be
   scanned either forward or backward, it is not normally useful to create a
   single-column <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>DESC</TT
> index &mdash; that sort ordering is already
   available with a regular index.  The value of these options is that
   multicolumn indexes can be created that match the sort ordering requested
   by a mixed-ordering query, such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT ... ORDER BY x ASC, y
   DESC</TT
>.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULLS</TT
> options are useful if you need to support
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"nulls sort low"</SPAN
> behavior, rather than the default <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"nulls
   sort high"</SPAN
>, in queries that depend on indexes to avoid sorting steps.
  </P
><P
>   For most index methods, the speed of creating an index is
   dependent on the setting of <A
HREF="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAINTENANCE-WORK-MEM"
>maintenance_work_mem</A
>.
   Larger values will reduce the time needed for index creation, so long
   as you don't make it larger than the amount of memory really available,
   which would drive the machine into swapping.
  </P
><P
>   Use <A
HREF="sql-dropindex.html"
>DROP INDEX</A

   to remove an index.
  </P
><P
>   Prior releases of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> also had an
   R-tree index method.  This method has been removed because
   it had no significant advantages over the GiST method.
   If <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USING rtree</TT
> is specified, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX</TT
>
   will interpret it as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USING gist</TT

   of old databases to GiST.
