      However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their
      names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have
      auto-generated names following the convention
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN"</SPAN
>.  A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases.  So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers.  Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its
      triggers into the right order.
